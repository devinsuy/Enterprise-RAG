Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
<FinancialStatementPresentation> The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of <CompanyName>Apple Inc. </CompanyName>and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “<Org>Apple” </Org>or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. </FinancialStatementPresentation>

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
<DerivativeInstruments> The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. </DerivativeInstruments>
Foreign Exchange Risk
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to <TimeDuration>12 months</TimeDuration>. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within <TimeDuration>20 years</TimeDuration>. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<HedgingActivities> The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. </HedgingActivities>
Interest Rate Risk
<InterestRateHedging> To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. </InterestRateHedging>

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
<BusinessSeasonalityAndProductIntroductions> The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first <TimeDuration>quarter </TimeDuration>compared to other quarters in its fiscal <TimeDuration>year </TimeDuration>due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. </BusinessSeasonalityAndProductIntroductions>
Quarterly Highlights
<NetSalesIncrease> Total net sales increased <Percent>2% </Percent>or <NetSalesIncrease>$1.5 billion </NetSalesIncrease>during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of <Org>Services </Org>and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the <Org>U.S. </Org>dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022. </NetSalesIncrease>
<NewProductAnnouncements> At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air ® and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro ® , both powered by the new Apple M2 chip.
