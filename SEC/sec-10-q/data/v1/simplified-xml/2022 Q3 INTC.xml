A Quarter in Review
<RevenueBreakdown> Total revenue of <TotalRevenue>$15.3 billion </TotalRevenue>was down <RevenueDecrease>$3.9 billion </RevenueDecrease>year over year or <Percent>20%</Percent>, as CCG revenue decreased <Percent>17%</Percent>, DCAI revenue decreased <Percent>27%</Percent>, and NEX revenue increased <Percent>14%</Percent>. Q3 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment that continues to deteriorate, with slowing consumer demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. CCG revenue was down on lower Notebook volume in the consumer and education market segments, though Notebook ASPs were higher due to a resulting change in product mix. DCAI Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a competitive environment. NEX revenue increased primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products, partially offset by lower demand for <Org>Network </Org>Xeon. </RevenueBreakdown>

 Note 1 :
Basis of Presentation
<FinancialStatementPreparation> We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with <Org>U.S. GAAP</Org>, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2021 Form 10-K and as updated by our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022. </FinancialStatementPreparation>
<CriticalAccountingEstimates> We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates. </CriticalAccountingEstimates>

Operating Segments
<SegmentReportingChanges> We previously announced several organizational changes that would accelerate the execution and innovation of our Company by allowing us to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes reorganization of our business units to capture this growth and to provide increased transparency, focus and accountability. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the previously-announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information, and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022. </SegmentReportingChanges>
We now manage our business through the following operating segments:
• Client Computing (CCG)
• Datacenter and AI (<Org>DCAI</Org>)
• Network and Edge (NEX)
• Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics (AXG)
• <Org>Mobileye </Org>
• <Org>Intel Foundry Services </Org>(IFS)
<IntelArchitecture> We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel ® architecture. </IntelArchitecture>
<OperatingSegmentInformation> <Org>CCG</Org>, <Org>DCAI </Org>and <Org>NEX </Org>are our reportable operating segments. <Org>AXG</Org>, <Org>Mobileye</Org>, and <Org>IFS </Org>do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. AXG revenue includes integrated graphics royalties from our <Org>CCG </Org>and <Org>NEX </Org>operating segments and are recorded as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. </OperatingSegmentInformation>
<OperatingSegments> We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments. </OperatingSegments>
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
• historical results of operations from divested businesses;
• results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
• amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
• <Non-SegmentExpenses>employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments (beginning the first quarter of 2022, this includes all of our stock-based compensation); and </Non-SegmentExpenses>
• <AcquisitionCosts>acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. intel </AcquisitionCosts>

<JobTitle>CEO</JobTitle>, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and
<_testRef>test </_testRef>assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

Pending acquisition of <Org>Tower Semiconductor </Org>
<TowerSemiconductorAcquisition> During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire <AcquisitionTarget>Tower Semiconductor Ltd. </AcquisitionTarget>(<Org>Tower</Org>) in a cash for stock transaction expected to close within <TimeDuration>twelve months </TimeDuration>from the date of the agreement. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower will be converted into the right to receive <AcquisitionPrice>$53 </AcquisitionPrice>per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately <AcquisitionEnterpriseValue>$5.4 billion </AcquisitionEnterpriseValue>as of the agreement date. This transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If the agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of <TerminationFee>$353 million</TerminationFee>. </TowerSemiconductorAcquisition>

NAND Memory Business
<NANDMemoryBusinessDivestiture> In October 2020, we signed an agreement with <Org>SK hynix Inc. </Org>(<Org>SK hynix</Org>) to divest our NAND memory business for <TransactionValue>$9.0 billion </TransactionValue>in cash. The NAND memory business includes our <Org>NAND </Org>memory fabrication facility in <Org>Dalian</Org>, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the <Org>Fab </Org>Assets), our NAND <Medication>SSD </Medication>business (the <Org>NAND </Org><Medication>SSD </Medication>Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the <Org>NAND </Org>OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in <Number>two </Number>closings. </NANDMemoryBusinessDivestiture>
<FirstClosingDetails> The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021. At first closing, <Org>SK hynix </Org>paid <FirstClosingConsideration>$7.0 billion </FirstClosingConsideration>of consideration, with the remaining <RemainingConsideration>$2.0 billion </RemainingConsideration>to be received by the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain of <FirstClosingGain>$1.0 billion </FirstClosingGain>within Interest and other, net, and tax expense of <TaxExpense>$495 million</TaxExpense>. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, <DeferredConsideration>$583 million </DeferredConsideration>of the first closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between the first and second closing within Interest and other, net. </FirstClosingDetails>
<NANDMemoryWaferManufacturingandSaleAgreement> At the first closing, we sold to <Org>SK hynix </Org>the Fab Assets and the <Org>NAND </Org><Medication>SSD </Medication>Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the <Org>NAND OpCo Business </Org>to separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of <Org>Intel</Org>. The equity interest of the <Org>NAND OpCo </Org>Business will transfer to <Org>SK hynix </Org>at the second closing. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of <Org>SK hynix </Org>also entered into a <Org>NAND </Org>wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to <Org>SK </Org>hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries are variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most significantly impact their economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the <Org>NAND OpCo </Org>Business, and recorded a receivable for the remaining proceeds of <TransactionValue>$1.9 billion </TransactionValue>in Other long-term assets, which remains outstanding as of October 1, 2022. </NANDMemoryWaferManufacturingandSaleAgreement>

We expect <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>to spend up to <InvestmentAmount>$30.0 billion </InvestmentAmount>of investments in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our <Org>Ocotillo </Org>campus in <Org>Chandler</Org>, <USState>Arizona</USState>. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>based upon our and <Org>Brookfield</Org>’s proportional ownership, subject to the terms and conditions within the definitive agreement. The definitive agreement includes provisions that require us to utilize <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab</Org>’s expanded manufacturing capacity at specified minimum levels or be subject to penalties. <Org>Brookfield</Org>’s ownership stake as a non-controlling interest holder in <USState>Arizona </USState><Org>Fab </Org>will be shown as a separate component of equity within our consolidated balance sheet. The transaction with <Org>Brookfield </Org>is expected to close by the end of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. </Commitments>
Legal Proceedings
<LegalProceedings> We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. In the first quarter of 2021, we accrued a charge of <LitigationCharge>$2.2 billion </LitigationCharge>related to litigation involving <Org>VLSI</Org>, described below. Excluding this charge, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. </LegalProceedings>
European Commission Competition Matter
<ECAntitrustDecision> In 2001, the European <Org>Commission </Org>(EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by <AMDClaims>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. </AMDClaims>(<Org>AMD</Org>) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. In May 2009, the <Org>EC </Org>issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the <Org>EC </Org>found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The <Org>EC </Org>also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The <Org>EC </Org>imposed a fine in the amount of <Money>€1.1 billion (<FineAmount>$1.4 billion </FineAmount></Money>as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision. </ECAntitrustDecision>
<AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice> We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European <Org>Court of Justice</Org>. In November 2014, Intervener <Org>Association for Competitive Technologies </Org>filed comments in support of <Org>Intel</Org>’s grounds of appeal. The <Org>Court of Justice </Org>issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General <Org>Court </Org>to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. </AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice>

<Org>General Court </Org>appointed a panel of
<Number>five </Number>judges to consider our appeal of the
<Org>EC</Org>’s
2009 decision in light of the Court
<Org>of Justice</Org>’s clarifications of the law, and in
January 2022, the
General Court issued a decision annulling the
<Org>EC</Org>'s findings against
<Org>Intel </Org>regarding rebates as well as the fine imposed on
<Org>Intel</Org>, which was returned to
<Org>Intel </Org>in
February 2022. In
April 2022, the

<IntelSeeksDefaultInterestPayment> In a related matter, <Org>Intel </Org>filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the <Org>EC </Org>to pay <Org>Intel </Org>approximately <Money>€593 million </Money>in default interest. </IntelSeeksDefaultInterestPayment>
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
<SecurityVulnerabilities> In June 2017, a Google research team notified <Org>Intel </Org>and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 2, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. </SecurityVulnerabilities>
<IntelSecurityVulnerabilitiesLitigation> Numerous lawsuits have been filed against <Org>Intel </Org>relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of October 26, 2022, consumer class action lawsuits against <Org>Intel </Org>were pending in the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by <Org>Intel</Org>'s actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the United States District <Org>Court </Org>for the District <Org>of <USState>Oregon</USState></Org>, which entered final judgment in favor of <Org>Intel </Org>in July 2022 based on plaintiffs' failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of <Org>Appeals</Org>. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the <Org>Superior Court of Justice of Ontario</Org>, and a stay of a second case pending in the <Org>Superior Court of Justice of Quebec </Org>is in effect until November 2022. In Israel, the plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in the District Court of <Org>Haifa </Org>advised the court in September 2022 that it intends to seek leave in October 2022 to withdraw its motion for class certification and voluntarily dismiss the action. In Argentina, <Org>Intel Argentina </Org>was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. </IntelSecurityVulnerabilitiesLitigation>
<Plaintiff>VLSI Technology LLC </Plaintiff>v. <Org>Intel </Org>
<PatentLitigation> In October 2017, <PatentInfringementComplaint>VLSI Technology LLC </PatentInfringementComplaint>(<Org>VLSI</Org>) filed a complaint against <Org>Intel </Org>in the <Org>U.S. </Org>District <Org>Court </Org>for the Northern <Org>District </Org>of <USState>California </USState>alleging infringement of <PatentsinSuit><NumberofPatents>eight </NumberofPatents>patents acquired from <Org>NXP Semiconductors, <PatentOwner>N.V. </PatentOwner></Org></PatentsinSuit>(<Org>NXP)</Org>. The patents, which originated at <PatentOwner>Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. </PatentOwner>and <PatentOwner>NXP B.V.</PatentOwner>, are U.S. Patent Nos. <Number>7,268,588</Number>; <Number>7,675,806</Number>; <Number>7,706,207</Number>; <Number>7,709,303</Number>; <Number>8,004,922</Number>; <Number>8,020,014</Number>; <Number>8,268,672</Number>; and <Number>8,566,836</Number>. <Org>VLSI </Org>accuses various <Org>FPGA </Org>and processor products of infringement. <Org>VLSI </Org>estimated its damages to be at least <EstimatedDamages>$5.5 billion</EstimatedDamages>, and its complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, <Org>Intel </Org>filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (<Org>PTAB</Org>) instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the <Org>PTAB </Org>found all claims of the '<Number>588 </Number>and '<Number>303 </Number>patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The <Org>PTAB </Org>found the challenged claims of the '014, '672, and '207 patents to be patentable. <Org>Intel </Org>appealed the <Org>PTAB</Org>'s decision as to '014, '672 and '207 patents. The Federal Circuit affirmed the <Org>PTAB</Org>'s decision as to the '672 and '<Number>207 </Number>patents, but reversed and remanded as to the '014 patent. <Org>Intel </Org>moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 pending the appeal. In June 2020, the District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August <Number>2021</Number>. The court lifted the stay in September <Number>2021</Number>, and scheduled a trial for March <Number>2024</Number>. </PatentLitigation>
<PatentInfringementLitigation> In June 2018, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a second suit against <Org>Intel</Org>, in <Org>U.S. </Org>District <Org>Court </Org>for the District <Org>of <USState>Delaware</USState></Org>, alleging infringement by various <Org>Intel processors </Org>of <Number>five </Number>additional patents acquired from <Org>NXP</Org>: U.S. Patent Nos. <Number>6,212,663</Number>; <Number>7,246,027</Number>; <Number>7,247,552</Number>; 7,523,331; and <Number>8,081,026</Number>. <Org>VLSI </Org>accused <Org>Intel </Org>of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed <Org>VLSI</Org>’s claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit except the ‘027 patent, and also dismissed <Org>VLSI</Org>’s allegations of indirect infringement as to the ‘633, ‘331, and ‘<Number>026 </Number>patents. In June 2019, <Org>Intel </Org>filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of certain claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, <Org>VLSI </Org>said that it was no longer asserting any claims of the ‘633 patent. In January and February 2020, the <Org>PTAB </Org>instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents, but declined to institute review on the '027 patent. As a result, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. In January 2021, the <Org>PTAB </Org>invalidated certain asserted claims of the ‘026 patent, and in February the <Org>PTAB </Org>invalidated all asserted claims of the ‘552 patent. Both parties filed notices of appeal regarding the <Org>PTAB</Org>’s decision as to the ‘026 patent in March 2021, and in April 2021, VLSI filed a notice of appeal of the <Org>PTAB</Org>'s decision as to the '552 patent. The case remains stayed as to both of those patents. For the '027 and '331 patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately <IntellectualPropertyValue>$4.13 billion </IntellectualPropertyValue>plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. The parties have completed summary judgment and expert witness testimony briefing. </PatentInfringementLitigation>

June 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part
<Org>Intel</Org>’s motion to exclude testimony of
<Org>VLSI</Org>’s technical expert, barring him from testifying regarding
<Org>Intel</Org>’s purported litigation misconduct and the alleged benefits of certain claims of the ‘
<Number>027 </Number>patent. In
August 2022, the court stayed the case in light of
<Org>VLSI</Org>'s failure to fully disclose its investors pursuant to the court's standing order.
<PatentInfringementLawsuits> In March 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a third suit against <Org>Intel</Org>, also in <Org>U.S. District Court </Org>for the District <Org>of <USState>Delaware</USState></Org>, alleging infringement of <Number>six </Number>more patents acquired from <Org>NXP</Org>: U.S. Patent Nos. <Number>6,366,522</Number>; <Number>6,663,187</Number>; <Number>7,292,485</Number>; <Number>7,606,983</Number>; <Number>7,725,759</Number>; and <Number>7,793,025</Number>. In April 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>voluntarily dismissed this <USState>Delaware </USState>case without prejudice. In April 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed <Number>three </Number>new infringement suits against <Org>Intel </Org>in the Western District of <USState>Texas </USState>(<Org>WDTX</Org>) accusing various <Org>Intel </Org>processors of infringement. The <Number>three </Number>suits collectively assert the same <PatentsAsserted><PatentsAsserted><NumberofPatents>six </NumberofPatents><PatentsAsserted>patents from the voluntarily dismissed </PatentsAsserted></PatentsAsserted><USState>Delaware </USState></PatentsAsserted>case plus <Number>two </Number>additional patents acquired from <Org>NXP, U.S. </Org>Patent Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. <Org>VLSI </Org>accuses <Org>Intel </Org>of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and interest. In the first <USState>Texas </USState>case, <Org>VLSI </Org>asserted the ‘373 and ‘759 patents (in December 2020 the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the ‘357 patent, which had also been asserted in the first <USState>Texas </USState>case). That case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded a “lump sum” to <Org>VLSI </Org>of <IntelPatentInfringementDamages>$1.5 billion </IntelPatentInfringementDamages>for literal infringement of the ‘373 patent and <PatentInfringementDamages>$675 million </PatentInfringementDamages>for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of the ‘759 patent. The jury found that <Org>Intel </Org>had not willfully infringed either patent. <Org>Intel </Org>challenged the verdict with post-trial motions, including filing in May 2021 a motion for a new trial, which the court denied in August, a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the ‘373 and ‘759 patents are not infringed and the ‘759 patent is invalid, and a motion that VLSI is entitled to no damages, both of which the court denied in March 2022. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment and awarded VLSI <IntelPatentInfringementDamages>$2.175 billion </IntelPatentInfringementDamages>in damages, approximately <PatentInfringementDamages>$162.3 million </PatentInfringementDamages>in pre-judgment interest, and post-judgment interest at the Treasury Bill rate, compounded <Frequency>annually</Frequency>. <Org>Intel </Org>filed its opening appellate brief in September 2022. </PatentInfringementLawsuits>
<PatentInfringementLitigation> The second <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that <Org>Intel </Org>does not infringe the ‘522 and ‘<Number>187 </Number>patents. <Org>VLSI </Org>had sought approximately <DamagesSought>$3.0 billion </DamagesSought>for alleged infringement of those patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment following second trial in <USState>Texas</USState>. </PatentInfringementLitigation>
<TexasLitigationUpdate> The third <USState>Texas </USState>case was set for trial in April 2022 but was cancelled after the first day due to a <Number>COVID-19 </Number>outbreak. A new trial date has been set for November 2022. In that case, <Org>VLSI </Org>initially sought approximately <Money><DamagesDemand>$2.2 </DamagesDemand>- </Money><DamagesDemand>$2.4 billion </DamagesDemand>for alleged infringement of the ‘983, ‘025 and ‘485 patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In April 2022, <Org>VLSI </Org>informed the court that it would not present an infringement case at trial for the '<Number>025 </Number>patent. Later in April 2022, <Org>VLSI </Org>informed the court that it would not present willful infringement or an infringement case for the '<Number>485 </Number>patent at trial. This limits <Org>VLSI</Org>'s damages demand to approximately <DamagesDemand>$1.0 billion </DamagesDemand>for the alleged infringement of the remaining '983 patent. </TexasLitigationUpdate>
<PatentInfringementCase> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a case in <Org>Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court </Org>against <Org>Intel, <Defendant>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Defendant></Org>, <Defendant>Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.</Defendant>, and <Defendant><Org>Intel Products (</Org><Org>Chengdu) Co., Ltd. </Org></Defendant><Org>VLSI </Org>asserts Chinese Patent <Number>201410094015.9 </Number>accusing certain <Org>Intel Core processors </Org>of infringement. <Org>VLSI </Org>requests an injunction as well as <Money>RMB 1 million </Money>in damages and <Money>RMB 300 thousand </Money>in expenses. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the <Org>CNIPA</Org>, which held a hearing in September 2021. The <Org>CNIPA </Org>has not yet issued a decision. In May 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 2020 and the second in July 2021. The court also held trial proceedings in the hearing in July 2021 and concluded that further trial proceedings were needed but indicated those would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the <Org>CNIPA</Org>. In July 2021, <Org>VLSI </Org>dismissed its case, but refiled it in August 2021. <Org>VLSI </Org>seeks an injunction in its newly filed case, as well as <Money>RMB 1.3 million </Money>in reasonable costs and expenses, but no damages. In November 2021, <Org>Intel </Org>moved for a stay of the August 2021 action pending a ruling on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on that motion. </PatentInfringementCase>
<PatentLitigation> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a second case in <Org>Shanghai </Org>Intellectual Property Court against <Defendant>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Defendant>, <Defendant>Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.</Defendant>, and <Defendant><Org>Intel Products (</Org><Org>Chengdu) Co., Ltd. </Org></Defendant><Org>VLSI </Org>asserts Chinese Patent <Number>201080024173.7</Number>. <Org>VLSI </Org>accuses certain <Org>Intel Core </Org>processors and seeks an injunction, as well as <Money>RMB 1 million </Money>in damages and <Money>RMB 300 thousand </Money>in expenses. Defendants filed with the <Org>CNIPA </Org>an invalidation petition in October 2019, and the <Org>CNIPA </Org>held a hearing in September 2021, but has not yet issued a decision. In June 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held its first evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The court held a second evidentiary hearing in December 2020, and a trial the same month. At trial, <Org>VLSI </Org>dropped its monetary damages claim, but still requested expenses (<Money>RMB 300 thousand</Money>) and an injunction. The court has not yet issued a decision following the trial. Rather, the court stayed the case in December 2020 pending a determination on invalidity by the <Org>CNIPA</Org>. In March 2022, the <Org>CNIPA </Org>issued an order holding the claims of the patent to be valid. The court held a second trial in May 2022 following the <Org>CNIPA </Org>ruling, but has yet to issue its final decision. </PatentLitigation>
<Intelv.FortressInvestmentGroup> In November 2019, <Org>Intel</Org>, along with <Defendant>Apple Inc.</Defendant>, filed a complaint against <Defendant>Fortress Investment Group LLC</Defendant>, <DefendantName>Fortress Credit Co.

Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and <USState>California </USState>Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In 2020 and 2021, the court twice dismissed plaintiffs' complaint with leave to amend. In December 2020, the court granted a joint motion by <Org>Apple </Org>and <Org>Seven Networks </Org>to dismiss with prejudice <Org>Apple</Org>’s claims against <Org>Seven Networks</Org>. <Org>Plaintiffs </Org>filed a second amended complaint in March 2021. Defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in May 2021. <Org>Apple </Org>withdrew from the case and dismissed its claims in June 2021.

June 2020, affiliates controlled by

<Org>VLSI</Org>, acquired
<Defendant>Finjan Holdings, Inc. </Defendant>
<Org>Intel </Org>had signed a “Settlement, Release and Patent License Agreement” with
<Org>Finjan </Org>in
2012, acquiring a license to the patents of
<Org>Finjan </Org>and its affiliates, current or future, through a capture period of
November 20, 2022. The agreement also contains covenants wherein
<Org>Finjan </Org>agrees to cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such,
<Org>Intel </Org>maintains that it now has a license to the patents of
<Org>VLSI</Org>, which has become a
<Org>Finjan </Org>affiliate, and that
<Org>Finjan </Org>must cause
<Org>VLSI </Org>to dismiss its suits against
<Org>Intel</Org>. In
August 2020,
<Org>Intel </Org>started dispute resolution proceedings under the agreement. As a part of this dispute resolution process,
<Org>Intel </Org>and
<Org>Finjan </Org>held a mediation in
December 2020, but failed to resolve their differences.
<Org>Intel </Org>filed suit to enforce its rights under the
License Agreement with
<Org>Finjan </Org>in
January 2021 in
<USState>Delaware </USState>Chancery Court. In
March 2021, defendants filed motions to dismiss the Chancery Court proceedings. The court heard those motions in
May 2021, and dismissed all of
<Org>Intel</Org>’s claims—except the breach of contract claim—with prejudice in
September 2021 for lack of jurisdiction because, the court reasoned,
<Org>Intel</Org>’s license defense has been raised in the other U.S. suits between
<Org>Intel </Org>and
<Org>VLSI </Org>and could be adjudicated in one of those actions. The court stayed
<Org>Intel</Org>’s breach of contract claim pending a determination on whether
<Org>Intel </Org>is licensed to
<Org>VLSI</Org>’s patents. In
September 2020,
<Org>Intel </Org>filed motions to stay the
<USState>Texas</USState>,
<USState>Delaware</USState>, and Shanghai matters pending resolution of its dispute with
<Org>Finjan</Org>. In
November 2020,
<Org>Intel </Org>filed a motion to stay the
<Org>Shenzhen </Org>matter pending resolution of its dispute with
<Org>Finjan</Org>. In
November 2020, the
<USState>Delaware </USState>Court denied
<Org>Intel</Org>’s motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally,
<Org>Intel </Org>filed a motion to amend its answer in the
<USState>Texas </USState>matters to add a license defense in November
2020, and filed a motion to amend its answer in the
<USState>Delaware </USState>matter to add a license defense in February
2021. The
<USState>Delaware </USState>Court granted
<Org>Intel</Org>'s motion in July
2021, but in March
2022, the
<USState>Texas </USState>Court denied
<Org>Intel</Org>'s motion, holding, among other things, that it would be futile for
<Org>Intel </Org>to add the license defense as it would not be meritorious.
<Org>Intel </Org>has appealed this ruling as a part of its appeal of the verdict in the first VLSI
<USState>Texas </USState>trial.
<IntelIPRAppeals> In October and November 2019, and in February 2020, <Org>Intel </Org>filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in <Org>WDTX</Org>. Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all of these petitions on a discretionary basis and without reviewing the merits. <Org>Intel </Org>requested a rehearing, and review from the POP as to all petitions. All requests for POP review and rehearing were denied. <Org>Intel </Org>filed notices of appeal regarding the discretionary denials for all petitions in February and March of 2021. The <Org>Federal Circuit </Org>dismissed the appeals in May 2021 for lack of jurisdiction. The <Org>Federal </Org>Circuit denied <Org>Intel</Org>’s petition for hearing en banc in August 2021.

<IntelJoinderMotions> In June 2021, <IPRPetitioner>OpenSky Industries LLC </IPRPetitioner>(<Org>OpenSky</Org>) requested IPR of certain claims of the '373 and '<IntelJoinderMotions><IntelJoinderMotions><IntelJoinderMotions>759 </IntelJoinderMotions><PatentsatIssue>patents at-issue in the first </PatentsatIssue></IntelJoinderMotions><USState>Texas </USState></IntelJoinderMotions>case, including those claims found to be infringed in that judgment.

Another entity named <Org><Petitioner>Patent Quality Assurance LLC </Petitioner>(PQA) </Org>also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the '373 patent, those claims found to be infringed in the first <USState>Texas </USState>case judgment. <Org>PQA </Org>also largely copied <Org>Intel</Org>'s petition, but (<Number>1</Number>) added a challenge to an additional claim and (<Number>2</Number>) included newly signed declarations from <Org>Intel</Org>'s experts. In December 2021, the <Org>PTAB </Org>instituted <Org>OpenSky</Org>'s petition on the '759 patent, but declined to institute on the '<Number>373 </Number>patent. In December 2021, <Org>Intel </Org>filed a motion to join <Org>OpenSky</Org>'s '759 IPR. In January 2022, the <Org>PTAB </Org>instituted <Org>PQA</Org>'s petition on the '<Number>373 </Number>patent. In February, <Org>Intel </Org>filed a motion to join <Org>PQA</Org>'s petition. Both of <Org>Intel</Org>'s joinder motions were granted in June 2022, allowing <Org>Intel </Org>to participate in the IPRs. Hearings were held in September 2022 for the <Org>OpenSky </Org>petition and in October 2022 for the PQA petition. PTAB decisions are expected in December 2022 on the '759 patent, and January 2023 on the '373 patent. At the same time, the Director <Org>of </Org>the <Org>United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office </Org>is reviewing both the <Org>OpenSky </Org>and <Org>PQA </Org><Org>IPRs </Org>to determine if they should be allowed to proceed to final written decisions. The Director has said that that process may delay the final written decision of the '759 patent IPR, but has not made any similar statement regarding the timeline for the '373 patent IPR. </IntelJoinderMotions>
<IntelLitigationCharge> After consideration of the verdicts in the WDTX cases and the additional pending lawsuits filed by <Org>VLSI</Org>, <Org>Intel </Org>accrued a charge of <IntelAccrual>$2.2 billion </IntelAccrual>in the first quarter of 2021 and anticipates losses, if any, in excess of this amount would be immaterial to the financial statements. We dispute <Org>VLSI</Org>’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them. </IntelLitigationCharge>
Litigation Related to <Number>7</Number>nm Product Delay Announcement
<SecuritiesClassActionLawsuits> Starting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern <Org>District </Org>of <USState>California </USState>against <Org>Intel </Org>and certain current and former officers based on <Org>Intel</Org>’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of <Org>Intel </Org>stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, <Org>Intel </Org>introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now Intel 4. </SecuritiesClassActionLawsuits>

Management's Discussion and Analysis
_I
 <FinancialReporting> This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our business, operating segments, risk factors, critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates, among other important information. </FinancialReporting>
<SegmentReportingChanges> We previously announced several organizational changes that we believe will accelerate the execution and innovation of our Company by allowing us to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. These changes include the reorganization of our business units to be positioned to capture this growth and to provide increased transparency, focus and accountability. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in Q1 2022 to align to this previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022. </SegmentReportingChanges>
"Note 2:
<SegmentRevenuesandOperatingMarginLoss>Operating Segments” within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form <Number>10</Number>-Q reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total revenues, and our segment operating margin (loss) presented below to our total operating margin (loss), for each of the periods presented. </SegmentRevenuesandOperatingMarginLoss>
For additional key highlights of our results of operations, see "A Quarter in Review."

<MacroeconomicUncertainty> Q3 <Number>2022 </Number>and YTD 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment that continues to deteriorate, with slowing consumer demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, and that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. We expect the macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging market environment will extend into 2023. </MacroeconomicUncertainty>
<Number>Q3 </Number><Number>2022 </Number>vs. <Number>Q3 </Number><Number>2021 </Number>
<RevenueDecrease> Our Q3 2022 revenue was <Revenue>$15.3 billion</Revenue>, down <RevenueDecrease>$3.9 billion </RevenueDecrease>or <Percent>20% </Percent>from Q3 2021. CCG revenue decreased <Percent>17% </Percent>from Q3 2021 due to lower Notebook volume in the consumer and education market segments, though Notebook ASPs increased due to a resulting change in product mix. <Org>CCG </Org>also had lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5<Org>G </Org>smartphone modem business. DCAI revenue decreased <Percent>27% </Percent>from Q3 2021. Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a competitive environment. NEX revenue increased <Percent>14% </Percent>from Q3 2021, primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products, partially offset by decreased demand for <Org>Network Xeon</Org>. The decrease in "all other" revenue reflects revenue of <DivestedNANDRevenue>$1.1 billion </DivestedNANDRevenue>in Q3 2021 related to the divested NAND memory business for which historical results are recorded in “all other." </RevenueDecrease>
<RevenueAccelerationProgram> Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, as well as increased demand from customers in advance of fourth quarter 2022 price increases, contributed approximately <IncentivesImpact>$1.5 billion </IncentivesImpact>to our revenue during the third quarter of 2022, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 as included in our Form 8-K dated October 27, 2022. </RevenueAccelerationProgram>
YTD <Number>2022 </Number>vs. YTD <Number>2021 </Number>
<RevenueBreakdown> Our YTD 2022 revenue was <Revenue>$49.0 billion</Revenue>, down <RevenueDecrease>$9.5 billion </RevenueDecrease>or <Percent>16% </Percent>from YTD 2021. CCG revenue was down <Percent>18% </Percent>from YTD 2021 due to lower Notebook and Desktop volume, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5<Org>G </Org>smartphone modem business. Notebook volume decreased driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, though ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. Desktop volume decreased driven by lower demand for consumer and education products. DCAI revenue decreased <Percent>8% </Percent>from YTD 2021 led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased <Percent>16%</Percent>, driven by increased demand for Ethernet and 5G products, accelerated demand for Edge products, and higher ASPs, partially offset by lower demand for <Org>Network Xeon</Org>. <Org>Mobileye </Org>revenue increased <Percent>27% </Percent>from YTD 2021 primarily driven by higher demand for <Org>EyeQ </Org>products. The decrease in our "all other" revenue is due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of <RevenueDecrease>$3.3 billion </RevenueDecrease>recognized in YTD 2021 for which historical results are recorded in “all other”, and <RevenueDecrease>$584 million </RevenueDecrease>of revenue recognized in YTD 2021 from a prepaid customer supply customer. </RevenueBreakdown>
<RevenueTrend> Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven Notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. For the remainder of 2022, we continue to expect a flatter trend than we historically observed as we experience the uncertainty and impacts, including on demand and the supply chain, of current macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns. </RevenueTrend>

<TaxBenefit> In Q3 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as we applied our estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income. In YTD 2022, we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in YTD 2021 due to lower income before taxes, a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-<Org>U.S. </Org>jurisdictions, and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&amp;D expenses that went into effect in January 2022. These YTD 2022 impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable tax rate effects associated with the gains recognized in YTD 2022 from the equity sale of <Org>McAfee </Org>and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. In Q3 2021 and YTD 2021, we recognized one-time tax benefits from the restructuring of certain non-<Org>U.S. </Org>subsidiaries. </TaxBenefit>

<FundingSources> We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next <TimeDuration>12 months </TimeDuration>and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments <Number>1 </Number>, as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and <_testRef>test</_testRef>, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of <AcquisitionCommitment>$5.4 billion </AcquisitionCommitment>associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate additional investments in the significant manufacturing expansion plans we announced as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy and additional investments to accelerate our process technology. </FundingSources>
Our cash and investments
<LiquidityManagement>and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and beginning in Q3 2022, selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. </LiquidityManagement>
<GovernmentIncentives> We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM <Number>2.0 </Number>investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. </GovernmentIncentives>
<LiquiditySources> In the third quarter of 2022, we issued a total of <SeniorNotesIssuance>$6.0 billion </SeniorNotesIssuance>aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of <GreenBondProceeds>$1.3 billion </GreenBondProceeds>principal amount. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations. We intend to use the proceeds from the remainder of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also received proceeds of <ProceedsfromBondSale>$140 million </ProceedsfromBondSale>in the aggregate from the sale of bonds issued by the <Org>Industrial Development Authority </Org>of the City <Org>of Chandler, <USState>Arizona </USState></Org>(<Org>CIDA</Org>). In the first quarter of 2022 we amended our <CreditFacilityAmount>$5.0 billion </CreditFacilityAmount>variable-rate revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>to March 2027 and transitioning the interest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the <Org>SEC</Org>, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to <TotalLiquidity>$10.0 billion</TotalLiquidity>. As of October 1, 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facility. </LiquiditySources>
<InvestmentPortfolio> We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities. </InvestmentPortfolio>

Operating Activities
<CashFlowfromOperations> Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. </CashFlowfromOperations>
<CashFlowAnalysis> The decrease in cash provided by operations in YTD 2022 was primarily driven by lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of <Org>McAfee </Org>and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our <Org>NAND </Org>business; and was also affected by cash-unfavorable working capital changes. </CashFlowAnalysis>
Investing Activities
<InvestingCashFlows> Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; cash used for acquisitions; and proceeds from divestitures. </InvestingCashFlows>
<InvestingActivities> Cash used for investing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of <Org>McAfee</Org>, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. </InvestingActivities>
Financing Activities
<FinancingCashFlows> Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, and repurchases of common stock. </FinancingCashFlows>
<FinancingActivities> Cash used for financing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to our curtailment of common stock repurchases and higher debt issuance, offset by higher debt repayments. </FinancingActivities>

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
<MarketRiskDisclosure> We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&amp;A in our 2021 Form 10-K. </MarketRiskDisclosure>
Risk Factors
<RiskFactors> The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2021 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022 (Q1 2022 Form 10-Q) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The Risk Factors section in our 2021 Form 10- K, as updated by our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q, remains current in all material respects. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&amp;A, and Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. </RiskFactors>
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
<InherentLimitations> Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. </InherentLimitations>
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
<DisclosureControls> Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </DisclosureControls>
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
<InternalControl> There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended October 1, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </InternalControl>
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
<ShareRepurchaseAuthorization> We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending October 1, 2022. As of October 1, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to <RepurchaseAuthorization>$110.0 billion</RepurchaseAuthorization>, of which <RemainingAuthorization>$7.2 billion </RemainingAuthorization>remained available. </ShareRepurchaseAuthorization>
<RSUWithholding> We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. </RSUWithholding>

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
<SanctionsCompliance> Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific U.S. economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the <Org>U.S. Secretary </Org><JobTitle>of State </JobTitle>designated the <Org>Federal Security Service of </Org>the <Org>Russian Federation (FSB) </Org>as a party subject to one such sanction. <Frequency>From time to time</Frequency>, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the <Org><Org>U.S. </Org>Department </Org>of the <Org>Treasury</Org>’s Office of Foreign <Org>Assets Control </Org>(OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the <Org>FSB</Org>. As announced on April 5, 2022, <Org>Intel </Org>suspended all business operations in Russia until further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the <Org>Russian </Org>Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law. </SanctionsCompliance>
<SanctionsCompliance> On April 15, 2021, the <Org>U.S. Department of the Treasury </Org>designated <Org>Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies)</Org>, a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with <Org>Positive Technologies </Org>regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by <Org>OFAC</Org>, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license. </SanctionsCompliance>

Exhibit <Number>10.3 </Number>
<EmployerName>INTEL CORPORATION </EmployerName>2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
1. Terms of Restricted Stock Unit.
<RestrictedStockUnit>This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, including any appendix attached hereto (this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement and such appendix, together, this “Agreement”), the Restricted Stock Unit Notice of Grant delivered online by logging into the <Org>E*TRADE Financial Corporation </Org>website (the “Notice of Grant”) and the <Org>Intel Corporation </Org>2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), as such may be amended <Frequency>from time to time</Frequency>, constitute the entire understanding between you and <GrantingCompany>Intel Corporation </GrantingCompany>(the “Corporation”) regarding the Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) identified in your Notice of Grant. The RSUs granted to you are effective as of the grant date set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant Date”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the 2006 Plan, the terms of the 2006 Plan will control. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement or in the Notice of Grant but defined in the 2006 Plan will have the same definitions as in the 2006 Plan. </RestrictedStockUnit>
2. Vesting of RSUs.
<VestingofRSUs>Provided that you continuously serve as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant up to and onto each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock, <Money>$.001 </Money>par value (the “Common Stock”), specified in the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) is not open, affected RSUs will vest on the next following Nasdaq business day. </VestingofRSUs>
<VestingConditions> RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors terminates for any reason except <Condition>death</Condition>, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. </VestingConditions>
3. Conversion into Common Stock.
<CommonStock>Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following the vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 8 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your <Condition>death </Condition>or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. </CommonStock>
<RSUConversion> Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation’s counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory </RSUConversion>
