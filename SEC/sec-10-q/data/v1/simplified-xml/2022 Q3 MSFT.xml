NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
<AccountingPrinciples> Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“<Org>GAAP</Org>”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the <CompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </CompanyName>fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the <Org>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission </Org>on July 28, 2022. </AccountingPrinciples>
Principles of Consolidation
<PrinciplesofConsolidation> The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of <ParentCompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </ParentCompanyName>and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. </PrinciplesofConsolidation>
Estimates and Assumptions
<FinancialStatementEstimatesandAssumptions> Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. </FinancialStatementEstimatesandAssumptions>
<ChangeinAccountingEstimate> In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from <TimeDuration>four years </TimeDuration>to <TimeDuration>six years</TimeDuration>. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended September 30, 2022, was an increase in operating income of <ChangeinOperatingIncome>$1.1 billion </ChangeinOperatingIncome>and net income of <NetIncomeImpact>$859 million</NetIncomeImpact>, or <ChangeinEstimateImpact>$0.12 </ChangeinEstimateImpact>and <ChangeinEstimateImpact>$0.11 </ChangeinEstimateImpact>per basic and diluted share, respectively. </ChangeinAccountingEstimate>
Financial Instruments
Investments
<InvestmentPolicy> We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>and remaining maturities of less than <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. </InvestmentPolicy>
<Number>8 </Number>
PART I
 Item 1
<InvestmentValuation> Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. </InvestmentValuation>
Derivatives
<DerivativeInstruments> Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. </DerivativeInstruments>
<FairValueHedgeAccounting> For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. </FairValueHedgeAccounting>
<HedgeAccounting> For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. </HedgeAccounting>
<DerivativeInstrumentHedging> For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. </DerivativeInstrumentHedging>
Fair Value Measurements
<FairValueMeasurementLevels> We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists <Number>three </Number>levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these <Number>three </Number>levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: </FairValueMeasurementLevels>
• Level <Number>1 </Number>–
<_1>inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include <Org>U.S. </Org>government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. </_1>
<Number>9 </Number>
PART I
 Item 1
• Level <Number>2 </Number>
<_2>– inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. </_2>
• Level 3 –
<Level>inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. </Level>
<InvestmentValuationMethodology> We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. </InvestmentValuationMethodology>

NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
<EarningsPerShareCalculation> Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. </EarningsPerShareCalculation>

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
<NOTE5DERIVATIVES> We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. </NOTE5DERIVATIVES>
Foreign Currencies
<ForeignCurrencyRiskManagement> Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures <Frequency>daily </Frequency>to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. </ForeignCurrencyRiskManagement>
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<ForeignCurrencyManagement> Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. </ForeignCurrencyManagement>
Interest Rate
<InterestRate> Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. </InterestRate>

Equity
 <Equity> Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. </Equity>
Credit
 <Credit> Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. </Credit>
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
<CreditRatingRequirements> Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of <MinimumLiquidityRequirement>$1.0 billion</MinimumLiquidityRequirement>. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of September 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of <Money>$1.0 billion</Money>. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. </CreditRatingRequirements>

<TaxRate> Our effective tax rate was lower than the <Org>U.S. </Org>federal statutory rate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. </TaxRate>

NOTE 14 — CONTINGENCIES
U.S. Cell Phone Litigation
<Litigation> <Org>Microsoft Mobile Oy</Org>, a subsidiary of <Org>Microsoft</Org>, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in <Number>46 </Number>lawsuits, including <Number>45 </Number>lawsuits filed in the Superior <Org>Court </Org>for the <USState>District <Org>of Columbia </Org></USState>by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain <Condition>tumors </Condition>and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire <Org>Nokia’s </Org>Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the <Org>Nokia </Org>defendants. <Number>Nine </Number>of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of <Org>Appeals </Org>for the <USState>District <Org>of Columbia </Org></USState>held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and <_testRef>testing </_testRef>around emission guidelines. </Litigation>
<ExpertEvidence> In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the <Org><USState>District of Columbia </USState>Court of Appeals </Org>challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the <Org>Court of Appeals </Org>issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. </ExpertEvidence>
Other Contingencies
<LegalClaims> We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise <Frequency>from time to time </Frequency>in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. </LegalClaims>
<LegalLiabilities> As of September 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of <LegalLiabilitiesAccrued>$264 million</LegalLiabilitiesAccrued>. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately <EstimatedLegalLiabilities>$500 million </EstimatedLegalLiabilities>in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. </LegalLiabilities>

Item 1
 <AllocationofRevenueandCosts> Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. </AllocationofRevenueandCosts>
<CostAllocationMethodology> In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. </CostAllocationMethodology>

<INDEPENDENTREGISTEREDPUBLICACCOUNTINGFIRM> To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of <CompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </CompanyName></INDEPENDENTREGISTEREDPUBLICACCOUNTINGFIRM>
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
<AuditorsReview> We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of <CompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </CompanyName>and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the <TimeDuration>three-month </TimeDuration>periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </AuditorsReview>
<AuditorsReport> We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the <AuditReport>Public <Org>Company </Org></AuditReport>Accounting <Org>Oversight Board </Org>(United <Org>States) </Org>(<Org>PCAOB</Org>), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 28, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. </AuditorsReport>
Basis for Review Results
<IndependentAuditorsReport> This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the <Org>PCAOB </Org>and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the <Org>Securities and Exchange Commission </Org>and the <Org>PCAOB</Org>. </IndependentAuditorsReport>
<ReviewofInterimFinancialInformation> We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the <Org>PCAOB</Org>. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the <Org>PCAOB</Org>, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. </ReviewofInterimFinancialInformation>

Industry Trends
<IndustryTrends> Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. </IndustryTrends>
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
<CompetitiveLandscape> The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. </CompetitiveLandscape>
<EmployeeAttractionandRetention> Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. </EmployeeAttractionandRetention>
<SupplyChainRisk> Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. </SupplyChainRisk>
<ForeignExchangeRisk> Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. </ForeignExchangeRisk>
Seasonality
<Seasonality> Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. </Seasonality>
Change in Accounting Estimate
<AccountingEstimate> In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from <TimeDuration>four years </TimeDuration>to <TimeDuration>six years</TimeDuration>. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended September 30, 2022, was an increase in operating income of <ChangeinOperatingIncome>$1.1 billion </ChangeinOperatingIncome>and net income of <ChangeinNetIncome>$859 million</ChangeinNetIncome>, or <ChangeinEstimateImpact>$0.12 </ChangeinEstimateImpact>and <ChangeinEstimateImpact>$0.11 </ChangeinEstimateImpact>per basic and diluted share, respectively. It is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 annual operating income by <AnnualOperatingIncomeIncrease>$3.7 billion</AnnualOperatingIncomeIncrease>. </AccountingEstimate>

<TaxRate> Our effective tax rate was lower than the <Org>U.S. </Org>federal statutory rate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. </TaxRate>

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
<CapitalResources> We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next <TimeDuration>12 months </TimeDuration>and thereafter for the foreseeable future. </CapitalResources>

Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. </CashEquivalents>

Valuation
<FairValueMeasurement> In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as <Org>U.S. </Org>government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level <Number>3 </Number>investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. </FairValueMeasurement>
<InvestmentPricing> A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level <Number>1 </Number>or Level <Number>2 </Number>investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level <Number>2 </Number>investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. </InvestmentPricing>

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
<CriticalAccountingEstimates> Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. </CriticalAccountingEstimates>
Revenue Recognition
<RevenueRecognition> Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. </RevenueRecognition>
<SSPEstimationMethodology> Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. </SSPEstimationMethodology>
<DeterminationofSellingPrice> In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. </DeterminationofSellingPrice>
<SAProgramAssessment> Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. </SAProgramAssessment>
<RevenueRecognition> Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. </RevenueRecognition>

Impairment of Investment Securities
<InvestmentImpairment> We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. </InvestmentImpairment>
<InvestmentImpairment> Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. </InvestmentImpairment>
Goodwill
<GoodwillAllocationandImpairmentTesting> We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. </GoodwillAllocationandImpairmentTesting>
<GoodwillImpairmentTest> Application of the goodwill impairment <_testRef>test </_testRef>requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. </GoodwillImpairmentTest>
<GoodwillImpairmentAssumptions> The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. </GoodwillImpairmentAssumptions>
Research and Development Costs
<ResearchAndDevelopmentCosts> Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and <_testRef>testing</_testRef>. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. </ResearchAndDevelopmentCosts>
Legal and Other Contingencies
<LegalProceedingsandClaims> The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. </LegalProceedingsandClaims>

Income Taxes
<IncomeTaxes> The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on <_testRef>examination </_testRef>by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than <Percent>50% </Percent>likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. </IncomeTaxes>
Inventories
<InventoryValuation> Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. </InventoryValuation>

<Item1A.RiskFactors> Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. </Item1A.RiskFactors>
STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
<STRATEGICANDCOMPETITIVERISKS> We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. </STRATEGICANDCOMPETITIVERISKS>
Competition in the technology sector
<CompetitionintheTechnologySector> Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. </CompetitionintheTechnologySector>
Competition among platform-based ecosystems
<BusinessModel> An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. </BusinessModel>
• <VerticalIntegration>A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. </VerticalIntegration>

 Item 1A
• <Competition>We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“<Org>OEM”</Org>) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. </Competition>
• <Competition>Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. </Competition>
Business model competition
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
• <SoftwareLicensingModel>Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license- based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. </SoftwareLicensingModel>
• <CompetitiveLandscape>Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. </CompetitiveLandscape>
• <Competition>Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. </Competition>
<CompetitivePressures> The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. </CompetitivePressures>
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.
<Cloud-BasedServices>A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in- class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as <Org>Azure</Org>, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and <Org>Azure </Org>Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. </Cloud-BasedServices>

• <PlatformAgnostic>Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. </PlatformAgnostic>
<RevenueGrowth> It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. </RevenueGrowth>
<FraudandAbuse> Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. </FraudandAbuse>
RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.
<InvestmentsinNewTechnology>We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like <Org>Edge </Org>and <Org>Bing</Org>, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. </InvestmentsinNewTechnology>
<TechnologyDevelopmentRisks> Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and <_testRef>testing </_testRef>periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. </TechnologyDevelopmentRisks>

 Item 1A
<AcquisitionStrategy>We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of <AcquisitionExample>ZeniMax Media Inc. </AcquisitionExample>for <AcquisitionPrice>$8.1 billion</AcquisitionPrice>, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of <AcquisitionTarget>Nuance Communications, Inc. </AcquisitionTarget>for <AcquisitionPrice>$18.8 billion</AcquisitionPrice>. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire <AcquisitionTarget>Activision Blizzard, Inc. </AcquisitionTarget>for <AcquisitionPrice>$68.7 </AcquisitionPrice></AcquisitionStrategy>
<AcquisitionandInvestmentRisks> billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. </AcquisitionandInvestmentRisks>
<GoodwillandIntangibleAssetImpairment> If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We <_testRef>test </_testRef>goodwill for impairment at least <Frequency>annually</Frequency>. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. </GoodwillandIntangibleAssetImpairment>
CYBERSECURITY, <Org>DATA PRIVACY</Org>, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS
<DATAPRIVACY> Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. </DATAPRIVACY>
Security of our information technology
<SecurityofOurInformationTechnology> Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state- sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. </SecurityofOurInformationTechnology>

<CybersecurityRisks> The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “<Org>Solorigate</Org>” or “<Org>Nobelium</Org>” are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to <Org>Solorigate</Org>/<Org>Nobelium </Org>as both a supplier and consumer of IT. </CybersecurityRisks>
<CybersecurityRisks> In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. </CybersecurityRisks>
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data
<SecurityThreats> The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“<TimeDuration>zero day</TimeDuration>”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. </SecurityThreats>
<SecurityRisks> Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. </SecurityRisks>
