A Quarter in Review
<RevenueDecrease> Total revenue of <Money>$11.7 billion </Money>was down <Money>$6.6 billion </Money>or <Percent>36% </Percent>from <Org>Q1 </Org>2022, as CCG revenue decreased <Percent>38%</Percent>, DCAI revenue decreased <Percent>39%</Percent>, and <Org>NEX </Org>revenue decreased <Percent>30%</Percent>. Q1 2023 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with slowing consumer and enterprise demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. We believe <Org>CCG</Org>, <Org>DCAI</Org>, and <Org>NEX </Org>customers, among others, tempered purchases to reduce their existing inventories and adjust to the macroeconomic uncertainty. CCG revenue decreased due to lower notebook and desktop volumes on lower demand, while notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core and older generation products. DCAI revenue decreased due to lower server volume resulting from a softening data center market, partially offset by an increase in revenue from the <Org>FPGA </Org>product line. <Org>NEX </Org>revenue decreased due to lower demand for <Org>Edge</Org>, <Org>Network Xeon</Org>, and <Org>Ethernet </Org>products. </RevenueDecrease>

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
_|
 Note 1 :
Basis of Presentation
<FinancialReportingCompliance> We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K. </FinancialReportingCompliance>
<FiscalYearEndDate> We have a <TimeDuration>52- or </TimeDuration><TimeDuration>53-week fiscal year </TimeDuration>that ends on the last <Weekday>Saturday </Weekday>in December. Fiscal year 2023 is a <TimeDuration>52-week fiscal year</TimeDuration>; fiscal 2022 was a <TimeDuration>53-week fiscal year</TimeDuration>, with the extra week included in the first quarter of 2022. </FiscalYearEndDate>
<CriticalAccountingEstimates> We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates. </CriticalAccountingEstimates>
Note 2 :
Operating Segments
<SegmentReportingChange> We previously announced the organizational change to integrate <Org>AXG </Org>into <Org>CCG </Org>and <Org>DCAI</Org>. This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023. </SegmentReportingChange>
We now manage our business through the following operating segments:
• Client Computing (CCG)
• <Org>Data Center and AI </Org>(<Org>DCAI) </Org>
• Network and Edge (NEX)
• <Org>Mobileye </Org>
• <Org>Intel Foundry Services </Org>(IFS)
<IntelArchitecture> We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel® architecture. </IntelArchitecture>
<OperatingSegmentInformation> <Org>CCG</Org>, <Org>DCAI </Org>and <Org>NEX </Org>are our reportable operating segments. <Org>Mobileye </Org>and <Org>IFS </Org>do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. </OperatingSegmentInformation>
<OperatingSegments> We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments. </OperatingSegments>
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
• <Non-ReportableSegments>results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives; </Non-ReportableSegments>
• historical results of operations from divested businesses;
• amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
• <ExpenseItems>employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and </ExpenseItems>
• <AcquisitionCosts>acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. </AcquisitionCosts>
<OperatingSegmentInformation> The CODM, who is our <JobTitle>CEO</JobTitle>, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and <_testRef>test </_testRef>assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. There have been no changes to our segment accounting policies disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K except for the organizational change described above. Net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows: </OperatingSegmentInformation>

Non-Controlling Interests
<Org>Semiconductor Co</Org>-Investment Program
<TransactionDetails> In 2022, we closed a transaction with <Org>Brookfield Asset Management </Org>(<Org>Brookfield) </Org>resulting in the formation of <Org><Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab LLC </Org>(<USState>Arizona </USState></Org></TransactionDetails>
<VIEConsolidation> Fab), a VIE for which we and <Org>Brookfield </Org>own <Percent>51% </Percent>and <Percent>49%</Percent>, respectively. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we fully consolidate the results of <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>into our consolidated financial statements. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>based on both parties’ proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and majority owner of two new chip factories that will be constructed by <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab</Org>, and we will have the right to purchase <Percent>100% </Percent>of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties. </VIEConsolidation>
<ConstructionCostCommitment> We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of <USState>Arizona </USState>Fab of <Money>$29.0 billion</Money>. </ConstructionCostCommitment>
<VIEAssetValuation> As of April 1, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab </Org>consisted of property, plant and equipment. The assets held by <Org><USState>Arizona </USState>Fab</Org>, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were <Money>$2.7 billion </Money>as of April 1, 2023 (<Money>$1.8 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022). </VIEAssetValuation>
<Non-ControllingInterestInformation> Non-controlling interest in <USState>Arizona </USState>Fab was <Money>$1.3 billion </Money>as of April 1, 2023 (<Money>$874 million </Money>as of December 31, 2022). Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest in <USState>Arizona </USState>Fab was <Money>$5 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to non- controlling interest in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022. </Non-ControllingInterestInformation>
<Org>Mobileye </Org>
<MobileyeInvestment> In October 2022, <Org>Mobileye </Org>completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of <Money>$1.0 billion</Money>. As of April 1, 2023, <Org>Intel </Org>held approximately <Percent>94% (94% </Percent>as of December 31, 2022) of the outstanding equity interest in <Org>Mobileye</Org>. Non- controlling interest in <Org>Mobileye </Org>was <Money>$1.0 billion </Money>as of April 1, 2023 (<Money>$1.0 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022). Net loss attributable to non- controlling interest in <Org>Mobileye </Org>was <Money>$5 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to non- controlling interest in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022. </MobileyeInvestment>

Note 4 :
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
<EarningsPerShareComputation> We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. </EarningsPerShareComputation>

<DilutedEarningsPerShareCalculation> Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Due to our net loss in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share. </DilutedEarningsPerShareCalculation>
<DilutedEarningsPerShare> Securities which were anti-dilutive were insignificant and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented. </DilutedEarningsPerShare>

Accounts Receivable
<Non-RecourseFactoringArrangements> We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions.

Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were <Money>$500 million </Money>during the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023, and we did not factor accounts receivable during the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022.

Investments
Short-term Investments
<InvestmentPortfolio> Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. </InvestmentPortfolio>
<HedgedInvestments> For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was <Money>$18.2 billion </Money>as of April 1, 2023 (<Money>$16.2 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of <Money>$90 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 (<Money>$411 million </Money>of net losses in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022). We recorded net losses on the related derivatives of <Money>$102 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 (<Money>$377 million </Money>of net gains in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022). </HedgedInvestments>
<MarketableDebtInvestments> Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was <Money>$7.0 billion </Money>as of April 1, 2023 (<Money>$10.2 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair value for these periods. The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of April 1, 2023, was as follows: </MarketableDebtInvestments>

Acquisitions
Acquisition of <Org>Tower Semiconductor </Org>
<TowerSemiconductorAcquisition> During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire <Org>Tower Semiconductor Ltd. </Org>(<Org>Tower</Org>) in a cash-for-stock transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower will be converted into the right to receive <Money>$53 </Money>per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately <Money>$5.4 billion </Money>as of the agreement date. We continue to work to close the transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If regulatory approvals are not received prior to August 15, 2023, and the agreement is terminated by either party, we may be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of <Money>$353 million</Money>. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment. </TowerSemiconductorAcquisition>
Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
<NANDMemoryBusinessSale> On December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with <Org>SK hynix Inc. </Org>(<Org>SK hynix</Org>) to divest our NAND memory business for <Money>$9.0 billion </Money>in cash. Our NAND memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the <Org>NAND OpCo </Org>Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests in as part of the sale. The transaction will be completed in <Number>two </Number>closings and upon first closing in the first <Street><HouseNum>three </HouseNum><StreetName>months 2022</StreetName></Street>, <Org><State>SK </State>hynix </Org>paid <Money>$7.0 billion </Money>of consideration and we recognized a pre-tax gain of <Money>$1.0 billion </Money>within interest and other, net, and tax expense of <Money>$495 million</Money>. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining proceeds of <Money>$1.9 billion </Money>which remains outstanding as of April 1, 2023, and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. </NANDMemoryBusinessSale>
<IncentivesandPenalties> The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the <Org>NAND OpCo </Org>Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to <MaximumExposure>$500 million </MaximumExposure><Frequency>annually</Frequency>, and <MaximumExposure>$1.5 billion </MaximumExposure>in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with <Org>SK <Org>hynix </Org></Org>to update the operating plan of the <Org>NAND OpCo Business </Org>in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the <Org>NAND OpCo </Org>Business against those metrics. </IncentivesandPenalties>
<ReceivablefromNANDOpCoBusiness> As of April 1, 2023, we also have a receivable due from the <Org>NAND OpCo Business</Org>, a deconsolidated entity, of <Money>$184 million </Money>recorded within other current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of approximately <Money>$35 million </Money>per quarter in 2023 for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries. </ReceivablefromNANDOpCoBusiness>

Legal Proceedings
<LitigationandLegalProceedings> We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of <Money>$2.2 billion </Money>related to litigation involving <Org>VLSI</Org>, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. </LitigationandLegalProceedings>

European Commission Competition Matter
<IntelAntitrustSettlement> In 2009, the European <Org>Commission </Org>(EC) found that <Org>Intel </Org>had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article <Number>54 </Number>of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the <Org>EC </Org>found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The <Org>EC </Org>ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a <Money>€1.1 billion </Money>fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009. </IntelAntitrustSettlement>
<AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice> We appealed the EC decision to the <Org>European Court of Justice </Org>in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the <Org>Court of Justice </Org>sent the case back to the <Org>General Court </Org>to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. </AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice>
<IntelAntitrustInvestigation> In January 2022, the General Court annulled the <Org>EC</Org>’s 2009 findings against <Org>Intel </Org>regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on <Org>Intel</Org>, which was returned to us in February 2022. In April 2022, the <Org>EC </Org>appealed the <Org>General Court</Org>’s decision to the <Org>Court of Justice</Org>. A hearing date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The <Org>General Court</Org>’s January 2022 decision did not annul the <Org>EC</Org>’s 2009 finding that <Org>Intel </Org>made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the <Org>EC </Org>reopened its administrative procedure to determine a fine against <Org>Intel </Org>based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. </IntelAntitrustInvestigation>
<IntelAppealsECDecision> In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay <Org>Intel </Org>approximately <Money>€593 million </Money>in default interest, which applications have been stayed pending the <Org>EC</Org>’s appeal of the <Org>General Court</Org>’s January 2022 decision. </IntelAppealsECDecision>
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
<SecurityVulnerabilities> In June 2017, a Google research team notified <Org>Intel </Org>and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. </SecurityVulnerabilities>
<IntelSecurityVulnerabilitiesLitigation> Numerous lawsuits have been filed against <Org>Intel </Org>relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of January 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against <Org>Intel </Org>were pending in the United States, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by <Org>Intel</Org>'s actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US <Org>District Court </Org>for the District <Org>of <USState>Oregon</USState></Org>, which entered final judgment in favor of <Org>Intel </Org>in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth <Org>Circuit </Org>Court of <Org>Appeals</Org>. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the <Org>Superior Court of Justice of Ontario</Org>, and a stay of a second case pending in the <Org>Superior Court of Justice of Quebec </Org>is in effect. In Argentina, <Org>Intel Argentina </Org>was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. </IntelSecurityVulnerabilitiesLitigation>
Litigation Related to <Number>7</Number>nm Product Delay Announcement
<SecuritiesClassActionLawsuit> Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the <Org>US District Court </Org>for the Northern <Org>District </Org>of <USState>California </USState>against <Org>Intel </Org>and certain officers following <Org>Intel</Org>’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. <Org>Plaintiffs </Org>purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired <Org>Intel </Org>common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, with leave to amend. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, <Org>Intel </Org>introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4. </SecuritiesClassActionLawsuit>

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
<IPClaims> We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. </IPClaims>
<Plaintiff>VLSI Technology LLC </Plaintiff>v. <Org>Intel </Org>
<IntellectualPropertyLitigation> In October 2017, <Org>VLSI Technology LLC </Org>(<Org>VLSI) </Org>filed a complaint against <Org>Intel </Org>in the US <Org>District Court </Org>for the Northern District of <USState>California </USState>alleging that various <Org>Intel FPGA </Org>and processor products infringe eight patents that <Org>VLSI </Org>acquired from <Org>NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP)</Org>. Four patents remain at issue in the case, and <Org>VLSI </Org>estimates its damages to be approximately <Money>$900 million</Money>, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. <Org>Intel </Org>filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the <Org>Patent </Org>Trial and Appeal Board (<Org>PTAB</Org>) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the <Org>PTAB</Org>'s review. The <Org>PTAB </Org>subsequently found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled trial for March 2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the <Org>PTAB</Org>. </IntellectualPropertyLitigation>
<IntelPatentInfringementLawsuit> In June 2018, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a second suit against <Org>Intel</Org>, in US District Court for the District <Org>of <USState>Delaware</USState></Org>, seeking <Money>$4.4 billion </Money>in damages for the alleged infringement by various <Org>Intel </Org>processors of <Number>five </Number>additional patents that <Org>VLSI </Org>acquired from <Org>NXP</Org>. In December 2022, <Org>VLSI </Org>stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which <Org>Intel </Org>paid nothing. The court dismissed the case in January 2023. </IntelPatentInfringementLawsuit>
<IntelAppealsTexasJuryVerdict> In April 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed three infringement suits against <Org>Intel </Org>in the <Org>US District Court </Org>for the Western <Org>District </Org>of <USState>Texas </USState>accusing various Intel processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from <Org>NXP</Org>. The first <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded <Org>VLSI </Org><Money>$1.5 billion </Money>for literal infringement of one patent and <Money>$675 million </Money>for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding <Org>VLSI </Org><Money>$2.2 billion </Money>in damages and approximately <Money>$162.3 million </Money>in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. <Org>Intel </Org>has appealed the judgment to the <Org>Federal Circuit Court </Org>of <Org>Appeals</Org>, including its claim to have a license from <Org>Fortress Investment Group</Org>’s acquisition of <Org>Finjan</Org>. In December 2021 and January 2022, the <Org>PTAB </Org>instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first <USState>Texas </USState>case, but it has not yet issued a final written decision on either petition. </IntelAppealsTexasJuryVerdict>
<IntelPatentLitigation> The second <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that <Org>Intel </Org>does not infringe the asserted patents. <Org>VLSI </Org>had sought approximately <Money>$3.0 billion </Money>for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment following the second trial in <USState>Texas</USState>. The third <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in November 2022, with <Org>VLSI </Org>asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded <Org>VLSI </Org>approximately <Money>$949 million </Money>in damages, plus a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment following the third trial in <USState>Texas</USState>. In February 2023, <Org>Intel </Org>filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. </IntelPatentLitigation>
<IntelLawsuit> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a case in <Org>Shenzhen Intermediate People</Org>’s Court against <Org>Intel, <Org>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Org></Org>, <Org>Intel Trading (</Org>Shanghai) </IntelLawsuit>
<PatentInvalidityProceedings> <Org>Co., Ltd.</Org>, and <Org><Org>Intel Products (</Org><Org>Chengdu) Co., Ltd. </Org></Org><Org>VLSI </Org>asserts one patent against certain <Org>Intel Core </Org>processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the <Org>China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA)</Org>, which held a hearing in September 2021. <Org>CNIPA </Org>has not yet issued a decision. The <Org>Shenzhen </Org>court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and stated that further trial proceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the <Org>CNIPA</Org>. <Org>VLSI </Org>seeks an injunction as well as <Money>RMB 1.3 million </Money>in costs and expenses, but no damages. </PatentInvalidityProceedings>
<IntellectualPropertyLitigation> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a case in <Org>Shanghai Intellectual </Org>Property Court against <Org>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Org>, <Org>Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.</Org>, and <Org><Org>Intel Products (</Org><Org>Chengdu) Co., Ltd. </Org></Org>asserting one patent against certain <Org>Intel </Org>core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where <Org>VLSI </Org>requested expenses (<Money>RMB 300 thousand</Money>) and an injunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, <Org>Intel </Org>filed a second petition to invalidate the patent at issue. </IntellectualPropertyLitigation>
<LitigationCharge> <Org>Intel </Org>has accrued a charge of approximately <Money>$2.2 billion </Money>related to the <Org>VLSI </Org>litigation. While we dispute <Org>VLSI</Org>’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings. </LitigationCharge>

2023 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with slowing consumer and enterprise demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. We believe
<Org>CCG</Org>,

Our effective tax rate decreased in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, due to a loss before taxes, the application of our estimated annual effective tax rate, and the unfavorable tax rate effects associated with the gains recognized in Q1 2022 from the equity sale of <Org>McAfee </Org>and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. </TaxProvision>

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
<table><tbody><tr><td>(In Millions) </td> <td/><td><Number>Apr 1, 2023 </Number></td> <td>Dec 31, 2022 </td></tr> <tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,232 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,144 </td></tr> <tr><td>Short-term investments </td> <td/><td>19,302 </td> <td/><td>17,194 </td></tr> <tr><td>Loans receivable and other </td> <td/><td>64 </td> <td/><td>463 </td></tr> <tr><td>Total cash and <Number>investments1 </Number></td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,598 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,801 </td></tr> <tr><td>Total debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,273 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,051 </td></tr></tbody></table>
<FundingSources> We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next <TimeDuration>12 months </TimeDuration>and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and <_testRef>test</_testRef>, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of <Money>$5.4 billion </Money>associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. </FundingSources>
Our cash and investments
<LiquidityManagement>and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. </LiquidityManagement>
<GovernmentIncentives> We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM <Number>2.0 </Number>investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. </GovernmentIncentives>
<DividendReduction> In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. </DividendReduction>
<DebtFinancing> In Q1 <Number>2023</Number>, we issued a total of <Money>$11.0 billion </Money>aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our <TimeDuration>5-year </TimeDuration><Money>$5.0 billion </Money>revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>to March 2028, and our <TimeDuration>364</TimeDuration>-day <Money>$5.0 billion </Money>credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the <Org>SEC</Org>, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to <Money>$10.0 billion </Money>and, as of April 1, 2023 we had <Money>$1.0 billion </Money>of commercial paper obligations outstanding. As of April 1, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. </DebtFinancing>
<InvestmentPortfolio> We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables were in investment-grade securities. </InvestmentPortfolio>

Operating Activities
<OperatingCashFlows> Operating cash flows consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. </OperatingCashFlows>
<OperatingCashFlow> The decrease in cash provided by operations in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 was primarily driven by our net operating loss in comparison to our net operating income for the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022. </OperatingCashFlow>
Investing Activities
<InvestingCashFlows> Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures. </InvestingCashFlows>
<InvestingActivities> Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 compared to the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022, primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business and proceeds for our remaining share of <Org>McAfee</Org>, both of which occurred in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022; as well as higher capital expenditures in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023. These unfavorable cash impacts during the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 were partially offset by the favorable cash impacts of lower purchases of short-term investments, net of maturities and sales, during the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023. </InvestingActivities>
Financing Activities
<FinancingCashFlows> Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. </FinancingCashFlows>
<FinancingActivities> Cash provided by financing activities in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2022 was primarily due to net proceeds from our debt issuance, partially offset by commercial paper repayments, during the first <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>of 2023. </FinancingActivities>
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
<MarketRiskDisclosure> We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&amp;A in our 2022 Form 10-K. </MarketRiskDisclosure>
Risk Factors
<RiskFactors> The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&amp;A, and Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. </RiskFactors>
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
<InherentLimitations> Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. </InherentLimitations>
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
<DisclosureControlsandProcedures> Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal <JobTitle>executive </JobTitle>officer and principal financial <JobTitle>officer</JobTitle>), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal <JobTitle>executive </JobTitle>officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange </DisclosureControlsandProcedures>
<InternalControlOverFinancialReporting> Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial <JobTitle>officer</JobTitle>, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </InternalControlOverFinancialReporting>
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
<InternalControlOverFinancialReporting> There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange </InternalControlOverFinancialReporting>
<MaterialChangesinInternalControl> Act) that occurred during the quarter ended April 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </MaterialChangesinInternalControl>
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
<ShareRepurchaseAuthorization> We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending April 1, 2023. As of April 1, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to <Money>$110.0 billion</Money>, of which <Money>$7.2 billion </Money>remained available. </ShareRepurchaseAuthorization>
<RSUWithholding> We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. </RSUWithholding>

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
<SanctionsCompliance> Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the <Org>US Secretary </Org><JobTitle>of State </JobTitle>designated the <Org>Federal Security Service </Org>of the <Org>Russian Federation (FSB) </Org>as a party subject to one such sanction. <Frequency>From time to time</Frequency>, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US <Org>Department </Org>of the <Org>Treasury</Org>’s Office of Foreign <Org>Assets </Org>Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, <Org>Intel </Org>suspended all business operations in Russia until further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law. </SanctionsCompliance>
<SanctionsCompliance> On April 15, 2021, the <Org>US Department of the Treasury </Org>designated <Org>Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies</Org>), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with <Org>Positive Technologies </Org>regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by <Org>OFAC</Org>, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license. </SanctionsCompliance>
