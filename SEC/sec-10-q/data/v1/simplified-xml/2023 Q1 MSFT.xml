NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
<AccountingPrinciples> Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“<Org>GAAP</Org>”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the <CompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </CompanyName>fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the <Org>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission </Org>on July 28, 2022. </AccountingPrinciples>
Principles of Consolidation
<PrinciplesofConsolidation> The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of <ParentCompanyName>Microsoft Corporation </ParentCompanyName>and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. </PrinciplesofConsolidation>
Estimates and Assumptions
<FinancialStatementEstimatesandAssumptions> Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. </FinancialStatementEstimatesandAssumptions>
<ChangeinAccountingEstimate> In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from <TimeDuration>four years </TimeDuration>to <TimeDuration>six years</TimeDuration>. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in operating income of <Money>$945 million </Money>and net income of <Money>$768 million</Money>, or <Money>$0.10 </Money>per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the <TimeDuration>six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in operating income of <Money>$2.0 billion </Money>and net income of <Money>$1.6 billion</Money>, or <Money>$0.22 </Money>per both basic and diluted share. </ChangeinAccountingEstimate>
Financial Instruments
Investments
<InvestmentPolicy> We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>and remaining maturities of less than <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. </InvestmentPolicy>
<Number>8 </Number>
PART I
 Item 1
<InvestmentValuation> Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. </InvestmentValuation>
Derivatives
<DerivativeInstruments> Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. </DerivativeInstruments>
<FairValueHedgeAccounting> For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. </FairValueHedgeAccounting>
<HedgeAccounting> For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. </HedgeAccounting>
<DerivativeInstrumentHedging> For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. </DerivativeInstrumentHedging>
Fair Value Measurements
<FairValueMeasurementLevels> We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists <Number>three </Number>levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these <Number>three </Number>levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: </FairValueMeasurementLevels>
• Level <Number>1 </Number>–
<_1>inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include <Org>U.S. </Org>government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. </_1>
• Level <Number>2 </Number>–
<_2>inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. </_2>
<Number>9 </Number>
PART I
 Item 1
• Level <Number>3 </Number>
<_3>– inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. </_3>
<InvestmentValuationMethodology> We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. </InvestmentValuationMethodology>
<FinancialAssetsandLiabilities> Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. </FinancialAssetsandLiabilities>
Contract Balances and Other Receivables
<OtherReceivablesDuefromSuppliers> As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, other receivables due from suppliers were <Money>$545 million </Money>and <Money>$1.0 billion</Money>, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. </OtherReceivablesDuefromSuppliers>
<Long-TermAccountsReceivable> As of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was <Money>$4.2 billion </Money>and <Money>$3.8 billion</Money>, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. </Long-TermAccountsReceivable>
<FinancingReceivables> We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, our financing receivables, net were <Money>$3.1 billion </Money>and <Money>$4.1 billion</Money>, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. </FinancingReceivables>
Employee Severance
<EmployeeSeveranceExpenses> On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately <Number>10,000 </Number>jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022, we recorded <EmployeeSeveranceExpenses>$800 million </EmployeeSeveranceExpenses>of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information. </EmployeeSeveranceExpenses>
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
<EarningsPerShareCalculation> Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. </EarningsPerShareCalculation>

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
<NOTE5DERIVATIVES> We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. </NOTE5DERIVATIVES>
Foreign Currencies
<ForeignCurrencyRiskManagement> Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures <Frequency>daily </Frequency>to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. </ForeignCurrencyRiskManagement>
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<ForeignCurrencyManagement> Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. </ForeignCurrencyManagement>
Interest Rate
<InterestRate> Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. </InterestRate>

Equity
 <Equity> Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. </Equity>
Credit
 <Credit> Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. </Credit>
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
<CreditRatingRequirements> Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of <Money>$1.0 billion</Money>. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of <Money>$1.0 billion</Money>. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. </CreditRatingRequirements>

<EffectiveTaxRate> Our effective tax rate was <Percent>19% </Percent>and <Percent>17% </Percent>for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and <Percent>19% </Percent>and <Percent>9% </Percent>for the <TimeDuration>six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the <TimeDuration>six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a <Money>$3.3 billion </Money>net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock- based compensation. </EffectiveTaxRate>
<TaxBenefitfromIntangiblePropertyTransfer> In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the <Org>U.S. </Org>The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a <NetIncomeTaxBenefit>$3.3 billion </NetIncomeTaxBenefit>net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the <Org>U.S. </Org>global intangible low-taxed income tax. </TaxBenefitfromIntangiblePropertyTransfer>
<TaxRate> Our effective tax rate was lower than the <Org>U.S. </Org>federal statutory rate for the <TimeDuration>three and six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. </TaxRate>
Uncertain Tax Positions
<UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsandOtherIncomeTaxLiabilities> As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were <Money>$17.1 billion </Money>and <Money>$16.3 billion</Money>, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. </UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsandOtherIncomeTaxLiabilities>
<IRSAuditSettlement> We settled a portion of the <Org>Internal Revenue Service </Org>(“<Org>IRS”</Org>) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of <IRSAuditSettlementPayment>$1.7 billion</IRSAuditSettlementPayment>, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. </IRSAuditSettlement>
<TaxContingencies> As of December 31, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the <Org>IRS </Org>audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved.

U.S. Cell Phone Litigation
<Litigation> <Org>Microsoft Mobile Oy</Org>, a subsidiary of <Org>Microsoft</Org>, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in <Number>46 </Number>lawsuits, including <Number>45 </Number>lawsuits filed in the Superior <Org>Court </Org>for the <USState>District <Org>of Columbia </Org></USState>by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain <Condition>tumors </Condition>and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire <Org>Nokia’s </Org>Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the <Org>Nokia </Org>defendants. <Number>Nine </Number>of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of <Org>Appeals </Org>for the <USState>District <Org>of Columbia </Org></USState>held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and <_testRef>testing </_testRef>around emission guidelines. </Litigation>
<ExpertEvidence> In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the <Org><USState>District of Columbia </USState>Court of Appeals </Org>challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the <Org>Court of Appeals </Org>issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. </ExpertEvidence>
Other Contingencies
<LegalClaimsandLitigation> We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise <Frequency>from time to time </Frequency>in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. </LegalClaimsandLitigation>
<LegalLiabilities> As of December 31, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of <Money>$181 million</Money>. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately <Money>$500 million </Money>in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. </LegalLiabilities>

Item 1
 <RevenueandCostAllocation> Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. </RevenueandCostAllocation>
<CostAllocationMethodology> In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount. </CostAllocationMethodology>

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
<CompetitiveLandscape> The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. </CompetitiveLandscape>
<EmployeeAttractionandRetention> Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. </EmployeeAttractionandRetention>
<SupplyChainRisk> Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. </SupplyChainRisk>
<ForeignExchangeImpact> Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the <TimeDuration>three and six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022. </ForeignExchangeImpact>
<CostReductionInitiatives> On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a <Money>$1.2 billion </Money>charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of <Money>$800 million</Money>, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we are reducing our overall workforce by approximately <Number>10,000 </Number>jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than <Percent>5% </Percent>of our total employee base. While we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. </CostReductionInitiatives>
<RiskFactors> Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. </RiskFactors>
Seasonality
<Seasonality> Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. </Seasonality>

Accounting Estimate
<ChangeinAccountingEstimate> In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from <TimeDuration>four years </TimeDuration>to <TimeDuration>six years</TimeDuration>. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in operating income of <Money>$945 million </Money>and net income of <Money>$768 million</Money>, or <Money>$0.10 </Money>per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the <TimeDuration>six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 was an increase in operating income of <Money>$2.0 billion </Money>and net income of <Money>$1.6 billion</Money>, or <Money>$0.22 </Money>per both basic and diluted share. It is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 annual operating income by <Money>$3.7 billion</Money>. </ChangeinAccountingEstimate>

The increase in our effective tax rate for the <TimeDuration>three months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the <TimeDuration>six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a <Money>$3.3 billion </Money>net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock- based compensation. </EffectiveTaxRate>

<TaxRate> Our effective tax rate was lower than the <Org>U.S. </Org>federal statutory rate for the <TimeDuration>three and six months </TimeDuration>ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. </TaxRate>

We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of <IRSAuditSettlementPayment>$1.7 billion</IRSAuditSettlementPayment>, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. </IRSAuditSettlement>
<TaxContingencies> As of December 31, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the <Org>IRS </Org>audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next <TimeDuration>12 months</TimeDuration>. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next <TimeDuration>12 months</TimeDuration>. </TaxContingencies>

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>

Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.

<InvestmentPricing> A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level <Number>1 </Number>or Level <Number>2 </Number>investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level <Number>2 </Number>investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. </InvestmentPricing>
Cash Flows

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
<CriticalAccountingEstimates> Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. </CriticalAccountingEstimates>
Revenue Recognition
<RevenueRecognition> Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. </RevenueRecognition>
<SSPEstimationMethodology> Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. </SSPEstimationMethodology>
<DeterminingSellingPrices> In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. </DeterminingSellingPrices>
<SAProgramAssessment> Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. </SAProgramAssessment>
<RevenueRecognition> Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. </RevenueRecognition>

Investment Securities
<InvestmentImpairment> We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. </InvestmentImpairment>
<InvestmentImpairment> Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. </InvestmentImpairment>
Goodwill
<GoodwillAllocationandImpairmentTesting> We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. </GoodwillAllocationandImpairmentTesting>
<GoodwillImpairmentTest> Application of the goodwill impairment <_testRef>test </_testRef>requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. </GoodwillImpairmentTest>
<GoodwillImpairmentAssumptions> The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. </GoodwillImpairmentAssumptions>
Research and Development Costs
<ResearchAndDevelopmentCosts> Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and <_testRef>testing</_testRef>. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. </ResearchAndDevelopmentCosts>
Legal and Other Contingencies
<LegalAndOtherContingencies> The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. </LegalAndOtherContingencies>

<IncomeTaxes> The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on <_testRef>examination </_testRef>by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than <Percent>50% </Percent>likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. </IncomeTaxes>
Inventories
<Inventories> Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. </Inventories>

STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
<CompetitiveLandscape> We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. </CompetitiveLandscape>
Competition in the technology sector
<CompetitionintheTechnologySector> Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. </CompetitionintheTechnologySector>
Competition among platform-based ecosystems
<EcosystemNetworkEffects> An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. </EcosystemNetworkEffects>
• <VerticalIntegration>A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. </VerticalIntegration>
• <Competition>We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“<Org>OEM”</Org>) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. </Competition>
