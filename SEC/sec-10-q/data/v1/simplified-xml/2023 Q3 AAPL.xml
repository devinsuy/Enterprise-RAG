Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
<FinancialStatementPresentation> The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of <CompanyName>Apple Inc. </CompanyName>and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “<Org>Apple” </Org>or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. </FinancialStatementPresentation>
<FiscalYearEnd> The Company’s <TimeDuration>fiscal </TimeDuration>year is the <TimeDuration>52- or </TimeDuration><TimeDuration>53-week </TimeDuration>period that ends on the last <Weekday>Saturday </Weekday>of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal <TimeDuration>quarter </TimeDuration>every <TimeDuration>five or six years </TimeDuration>to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first <TimeDuration>fiscal </TimeDuration>quarter of 2023.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
<DerivativeInstruments> The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. </DerivativeInstruments>
Foreign Exchange Risk
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to <TimeDuration>12 months</TimeDuration>. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<ForeignCurrencyHedging> To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt– related foreign currency transactions is <TimeDuration>19 years</TimeDuration>. </ForeignCurrencyHedging>
<CompanyName>Apple Inc. </CompanyName>| Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | <Number>8 </Number>
<AppleInc> The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. </AppleInc>
Interest Rate Risk
<InterestRateHedging> To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. </InterestRateHedging>

<CreditRiskMitigation> The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of <NetDerivativeAsset>$7.8 billion</NetDerivativeAsset>, resulting in a net derivative asset of <NetDerivativeAsset>$412 million</NetDerivativeAsset>. </CreditRiskMitigation>

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
<CreditRiskManagement> The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.

In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit- financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. </CreditRiskManagement>

Note 5 – Income Taxes
European Commission State Aid Decision
<EuropeanCommissionStateAidDecision> On August 30, 2016, the European <Org>Commission </Org>announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and <Org>Ireland </Org>appealed the State Aid Decision to the <Org>General Court </Org>of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European <Org>Commission </Org>appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. </EuropeanCommissionStateAidDecision>

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
<BusinessSeasonalityAndProductIntroductions> The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first <TimeDuration>quarter </TimeDuration>compared to other quarters in its fiscal <TimeDuration>year </TimeDuration>due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. </BusinessSeasonalityAndProductIntroductions>
