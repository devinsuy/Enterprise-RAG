A Quarter in Review
_I
 <RevenueDecrease> Total revenue of <Money>$14.2 billion </Money>was down <Money>$1.2 billion </Money>or <Percent>8% </Percent>from <Org>Q3 </Org>2022, as CCG revenue decreased <Percent>3%</Percent>, DCAI revenue decreased <Percent>10%</Percent>, and NEX revenue decreased <Percent>32%</Percent>. CCG revenue decreased due to lower desktop volume from lower demand across business market segments and lower notebook ASPs due to a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher notebook volume, as customer inventory levels began to normalize and higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines. </RevenueDecrease>

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
_I
 Note 1 :
Basis of Presentation
<FinancialReportingCompliance> We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K. </FinancialReportingCompliance>
<FiscalYearEndDate> We have a <TimeDuration>52- or </TimeDuration><TimeDuration>53-week fiscal year </TimeDuration>that ends on the last <Weekday>Saturday </Weekday>in December. Fiscal year 2023 is a <TimeDuration>52-week fiscal year</TimeDuration>; fiscal 2022 was a <TimeDuration>53-week fiscal year</TimeDuration>, with the extra week included in the first quarter of 2022. </FiscalYearEndDate>
<CriticalAccountingEstimates> We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10- K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates. </CriticalAccountingEstimates>
Note 2 :
Operating Segments
<SegmentReportingChange> We previously announced the organizational change to integrate <Org>AXG </Org>into <Org>CCG </Org>and <Org>DCAI</Org>. This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023. </SegmentReportingChange>
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
• Client Computing (CCG)
• <Org>Data Center and AI </Org>(<Org>DCAI) </Org>
• Network and Edge (NEX)
• <Org>Mobileye </Org>
• <Org>Intel Foundry Services </Org>(IFS)
<IntelArchitecture> We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel ® architecture. </IntelArchitecture>
<OperatingSegmentInformation> <Org>CCG</Org>, <Org>DCAI </Org>and <Org>NEX </Org>are our reportable operating segments. <Org>Mobileye </Org>and <Org>IFS </Org>do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. </OperatingSegmentInformation>
<OperatingSegments> We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments. </OperatingSegments>
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
• <Non-ReportableSegments>results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives; </Non-ReportableSegments>
• historical results of operations from divested businesses;
• amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
• <ExpenseItems>employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and </ExpenseItems>
• <AcquisitionCosts>acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. </AcquisitionCosts>
<OperatingSegmentInformation> The CODM, who is our <JobTitle>CEO</JobTitle>, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and <_testRef>test </_testRef>assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. There have been no changes to our segment accounting policies disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K except for the organizational change described above. </OperatingSegmentInformation>

<DilutedEarningsPerShare> Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.

<DilutedLossPerShareCalculation> Due to our net loss in the <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>ended September 30, 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share for the period and were excluded. </DilutedLossPerShareCalculation>

<TaxProvisionMethodology> Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. During the first <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>of 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions. </TaxProvisionMethodology>

Investments
Short-term Investments
<InvestmentDetails> Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. </InvestmentDetails>
<HedgedInvestments> For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was <Money>$16.1 billion </Money>as of September 30, 2023 (<Money>$16.2 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of <Money>$329 million </Money>in the third quarter of 2023 and net losses of <Money>$336 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>of 2023 (<Money>$861 million </Money>of net losses in the third quarter of 2022 and <Money>$1.8 billion </Money>of net losses in the first <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>of 2022). We recorded net gains on the related derivatives of <Money>$320 million </Money>in the third quarter of 2023 and net gains of <Money>$354 million </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>of 2023 (<Money>$916 million </Money>of net gains in the third quarter of 2022 and net gains of <Money>$1.8 billion </Money>in the first <TimeDuration>nine months </TimeDuration>of 2022). </HedgedInvestments>
<InvestmentValuation> Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was <Money>$6.1 billion </Money>as of September 30, 2023 (<Money>$10.2 billion </Money>as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair value for these periods. </InvestmentValuation>

Legal Proceedings
<LitigationandLegalProceedings> We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of <Money>$2.2 billion </Money>related to litigation involving <Org>VLSI </Org>and a charge of <Money>$<HouseNum>401 </HouseNum>million </Money>related to an <State>EC</State>-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the <Org>VLSI </Org>claims, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. </LitigationandLegalProceedings>

European Commission Competition Matter
<ECAntitrustDecision> In 2009, the <Org>EC </Org>found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article <Number>54 </Number>of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the <Org>EC </Org>found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The <Org>EC </Org>ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a <Money>€1.1 billion </Money>fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009. </ECAntitrustDecision>
<AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice> We appealed the EC decision to the <Org>European Court of Justice </Org>in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the <Org>Court of Justice </Org>sent the case back to the <Org>General Court </Org>to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. </AppealtotheEuropeanCourtofJustice>
<IntelRebateCase> In January 2022, the General Court annulled the <Org>EC</Org>’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the <Money>€1.1 billion </Money>fine imposed on <Org>Intel</Org>, which was returned to us in February 2022. The <Org>General Court</Org>’s January 2022 decision did not annul the <Org>EC</Org>’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. </IntelRebateCase>
<ECAntitrustInvestigation> In April 2022, the <Org>EC </Org>appealed the General Court’s decision to the <Org>Court </Org>of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the <Org>EC </Org>imposed a <Money>€376 million (<Money>$401 million</Money>) </Money>fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We plan to appeal the <Org>EC</Org>’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings. </ECAntitrustInvestigation>
<InterestPaymentClaim> In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the <Org>EC </Org>to pay us approximately <Money>€593 million </Money>in default interest on the original <Money>€1.1 billion </Money>fine that was held by the <Org>EC </Org>for <TimeDuration>12 years</TimeDuration>, which applications have been stayed pending the <Org>EC</Org>’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision. </InterestPaymentClaim>
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
<SecurityVulnerabilities> In June 2017, a Google research team notified <Org>Intel </Org>and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. </SecurityVulnerabilities>
<ClassActionLawsuits> As of October 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US <Org>District Court </Org>for the District <Org>of <USState>Oregon</USState></Org>, which entered final judgment in favor of <Org>Intel </Org>in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of <Org>Appeals</Org>. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior <Org>Court of Justice of Ontario</Org>, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior <Org>Court of Justice of Quebec </Org>is in effect. In Argentina, <Org>Intel Argentina </Org>was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. </ClassActionLawsuits>
Litigation Related to <Number>7</Number>nm Product Delay Announcement
<SecuritiesLitigation> Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US <Org>District Court </Org>for the Northern <Org>District </Org>of <USState>California </USState>against us and certain officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. <Org>Plaintiffs </Org>purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4. </SecuritiesLitigation>

IP Claims
<IPInfringementLawsuits> We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. </IPInfringementLawsuits>
<Plaintiff>VLSI Technology LLC </Plaintiff>v. <Org>Intel </Org>
<IntelFPGAandProcessorPatentLitigation> In October 2017, <Org>VLSI Technology LLC </Org>(<Org>VLSI</Org>) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of <USState>California </USState>alleging that various <Org>Intel FPGA </Org>and processor products infringe eight patents that <Org>VLSI </Org>acquired from <Org>NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP)</Org>. Four patents remain at issue in the case, and <Org>VLSI </Org>estimates its damages to be approximately <Money>$890 million</Money>, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (<Org>PTAB</Org>) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the <Org>PTAB</Org>’s review. The <Org>PTAB </Org>subsequently found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021, and scheduled trial for March 2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the <Org>PTAB</Org>. </IntelFPGAandProcessorPatentLitigation>
<VLSILawsuits> In April 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed <Number>three </Number>infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the <Org>Western District of <USState>Texas </USState></Org>accusing various of our processors of infringement of <Number>eight </Number>additional patents it had acquired from <Org>NXP</Org>: </VLSILawsuits>
• <IntellectualPropertyLitigation>The first <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded <Org>VLSI </Org><Money>$1.5 billion </Money>for literal infringement of one patent and <Money>$675 million </Money>for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding <Org>VLSI </Org><Money>$2.2 billion </Money>in damages and approximately <Money>$162.3 million </Money>in pre- judgment and post-judgment interest. We have appealed the judgment to the <Org>Federal Circuit Court of Appeals</Org>, including the court's rejection of <Org>Intel</Org>'s claim to have a license from <Org>Fortress Investment Group</Org>’s acquisition of <Org>Finjan</Org>. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2021 and January 2022 the <Org>PTAB </Org>instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first <USState>Texas </USState>case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; <Org>VLSI </Org>has appealed the <Org>PTAB</Org>’s decisions, and has asked to stay those appeals while the <Org>PTAB </Org>decides certain issues unrelated to the merits of the IPRs. <Org>Intel </Org>has agreed to the stay. </IntellectualPropertyLitigation>
• <PatentInfringementCase>The second <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. <Org>VLSI </Org>had sought approximately <Money>$3.0 billion </Money>for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment. </PatentInfringementCase>
• <LitigationOutcome>The third <USState>Texas </USState>case went to trial in November 2022, with <Org>VLSI </Org>asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded <Org>VLSI </Org>approximately <Money>$949 million </Money>in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. </LitigationOutcome>
<IntelLawsuit> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a case in <Org>Shenzhen Intermediate People</Org>’s Court against <Org>Intel, <Org>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Org></Org>, <Org>Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.</Org>, and <Org>Intel Products </Org>(<Org>Chengdu) </Org></IntelLawsuit>
<PatentInvalidated> <Org>Co., Ltd. </Org><Org>VLSI </Org>asserts one patent against certain <Org>Intel Core </Org>processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the <Org>China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) </Org>which held a hearing in September 2021. The <Org>Shenzhen </Org>court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. <Org>VLSI </Org>seeks an injunction as well as <Money>RMB 1.3 million </Money>in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the <Org>CNIPA </Org>invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. </PatentInvalidated>
<PatentInfringementCase> In May 2019, <Org>VLSI </Org>filed a case in <Org>Shanghai Intellectual </Org>Property <Org>Court </Org>against <Org>Intel (China) Co., Ltd.</Org>, <Org>Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.</Org>, and <Org><Org>Intel Products (</Org><Org>Chengdu) Co., Ltd. </Org></Org>asserting one patent against certain <Org>Intel </Org>core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where <Org>VLSI </Org>requested expenses (<Money>RMB 300 thousand</Money>) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. </PatentInfringementCase>
<VLSILitigationCharge> We have accrued a charge of approximately <Money>$2.2 billion </Money>related to the <Org>VLSI </Org>litigation. While we dispute <Org>VLSI</Org>’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings. </VLSILitigationCharge>
<Number>R2 </Number>Semiconductor Patent Litigation
<R2> In November 2022, <Org>R2 Semiconductor, Inc. </Org>(R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against <Org>Intel Corporation (UK) Limited </Org>and <Org>Intel Corporation</Org>, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional <Org>Court </Org>in Germany against <Org>Intel Deutschland GmbH </Org>and certain <Org>Intel </Org>customers. <Org>R2 </Org>asserts one European patent is infringed by <Org>Intel</Org>’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and <Org>Ice Lake Server </Org>(<Org>Xeon</Org>) processors, and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. <Org>R2 </Org>seeks an injunction in both actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. <Org>Intel </Org>is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit. </R2>

<Org>R2</Org>’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In
December 2022,
<Org>Intel </Org>responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the patent is invalid. In
April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a disproportionate remedy. In
May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the
German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.
<PatentLitigation> Trial is scheduled for December 2023 in the <Org><Org>Dusseldorf </Org>Regional Court</Org>, and for April 2024 in the UK High Court of Justice. If defendants lose at trial in Germany, the <Org>Dusseldorf </Org><Org>Regional Court </Org>could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of the accused products in Germany which could take effect immediately and remain in place unless overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court.

2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from
<TimeDuration>5 years </TimeDuration>to
<TimeDuration>8 years</TimeDuration>. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of
2022, we expect total depreciation expense in
2023 to be reduced by
<Money>$4.2 billion</Money>. We expect this change will result in an approximately
<Money>$2.5 billion </Money>increase to gross margin, a
<Money>$400 million </Money>decrease in R&amp;D expenses, and a
<Money>$1.3 billion </Money>decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of
2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Because most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is included in our
2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.

<RestructuringProgram> The <Number>2022 </Number>Restructuring Program was approved in Q3 <Number>2022 </Number>to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product execution in alignment with our strategy. In YTD 2023, activity related to the <Number>2022 </Number>Restructuring Program substantially related to cash settlement of previously accrued employee severance and benefit arrangements as well as additional actions in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.

<TaxBenefitRecognition> In Q3 2023, we recognized a benefit for taxes as we applied our year-to-date actual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income (loss) before taxes, which reflects our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. Our effective tax rate increased in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022, due to the application of our actual YTD effective tax rate, and our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. </TaxBenefitRecognition>
<TaxProvisionMethodology> Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. In YTD 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions. </TaxProvisionMethodology>

Cash generated by operations, and our total cash and investments <Number>1 </Number>as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by the company's committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity. Other sources of liquidity in 2023 include <Money>$1.1 billion </Money>from partner contributions, net proceeds of <Money>$1.6 billion </Money>from a secondary offering of <Org>Mobileye </Org>Class A common stock, and cash proceeds of <Money>$849 million </Money>from the sale of an approximate <Percent>20% </Percent>minority stake in our IMS business to Bain. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and <_testRef>test</_testRef>, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. </LiquidityandCapitalResources>
<CashFlowManagement> Our total cash and investments <Number>1 </Number>and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions. </CashFlowManagement>
<GovernmentIncentives> We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM <Number>2.0 </Number>investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments. </GovernmentIncentives>
<DividendReduction> In the first quarter of 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. </DividendReduction>
<DividendDeclaration> In October 2023 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of <Money>$0.125 </Money>per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on December 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2023.

<LiquidityandCapitalResources> In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of <Money>$11.0 billion </Money>aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our <TimeDuration>5-year </TimeDuration><Money>$5.0 billion </Money>revolving credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date by <TimeDuration>one year </TimeDuration>to March 2028, and our <TimeDuration>364</TimeDuration>-day <Money>$5.0 billion </Money>credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the <Org>SEC</Org>, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to <Money>$10.0 billion</Money>.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non- GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of <Percent>13% </Percent>across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a <TimeDuration>five</TimeDuration>-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>
<Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures> Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. </Non-GAAPFinancialMeasures>

 Form 8-K Disclosable Events
<CorrectedCertificateofIncorporation> On October 23, 2023, a corrected copy of the Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation of <Org>Intel Corporation </Org>was filed with the <Org>Secretary </Org><JobTitle>of </JobTitle><Org>State </Org>of the <Org>State </Org>of <USState>Delaware</USState>. </CorrectedCertificateofIncorporation>
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
<QuantitativeAndQualitativeDisclosuresAboutMarketRisk> We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&amp;A in our 2022 Form 10-K. </QuantitativeAndQualitativeDisclosuresAboutMarketRisk>
Risk Factors
<RiskFactors> The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&amp;A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections. </RiskFactors>
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
<InherentLimitations> Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. </InherentLimitations>
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
<DisclosureControls> Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </DisclosureControls>
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
<InternalControl> There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </InternalControl>
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
<ShareRepurchaseAuthorization> We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to <Money>$110.0 billion</Money>, of which <Money>$7.2 billion </Money>remained available. </ShareRepurchaseAuthorization>
<RSUWithholding> We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program. </RSUWithholding>

Rule <Number>10b5</Number>-<Number>1 </Number>Trading Arrangements
<_10b5> Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may <Frequency>from time to time </Frequency>enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification. </_10b5>
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
<SanctionsCompliance> Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the <Org>US Secretary </Org><JobTitle>of State </JobTitle>designated the <Org>Federal Security Service </Org>of the <Org>Russian Federation (FSB) </Org>as a party subject to one such sanction. <Frequency>From time to time</Frequency>, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US <Org>Department </Org>of the <Org>Treasury</Org>’s Office of Foreign <Org>Assets </Org>Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, <Org>Intel </Org>suspended all business operations in Russia until further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law. </SanctionsCompliance>
<SanctionsCompliance> On April 15, 2021, the <Org>US Department of the Treasury </Org>designated <Org>Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies</Org>), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with <Org>Positive Technologies </Org>regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by <Org>OFAC</Org>, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license. </SanctionsCompliance>
