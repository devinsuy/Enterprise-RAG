Students will develop their technical and non-technical skills as data scientists who focus on real-world and impactful applications and situations. The final project provides a learning opportunity and “sandbox” to integrate all skills and concepts learned throughout the MIDS program and provides experience and hands-on tools in formulating and implementing an impactful and compelling project. Students are evaluated on their ability to work in a dynamic team environment to collaborate, co-develop, and communicate their work. The capstone is completed as a group/team project (3–4 students), and each project will focus on open, pre-existing secondary data. A robust listing of open datasets will be made available before the capstone course begins.
