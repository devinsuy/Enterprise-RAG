5th Year MIDS Class Registration

Before Registration

Review upcoming semester dates on the 
MIDS, MICS & 5th Year MIDS Academic Calendar
. 

Check 
CalCentral
 to resolve any holds that could prevent you from registering.

Complete the 
required
 UC Berkeley 
Student Financial Agreement (SFA)
 before registering for classes the first time, as well as prior to the beginning of enrollment for the fall term every academic year. Students who do not sign will be unable to enroll in classes.

One week before registration, navigate to your CalCentral “My Academics” tab and confirm that the enrollment appointment on your “Class Enrollment” card is active and accurate. Note that dates and times are listed in Pacific Time. Be sure to click on the tab for the upcoming term; it is not the default.

When registering for DATASCI elective courses, review 
all course prerequisites prior
 to registration to confirm your eligibility for a particular course.

Second term only: if you are considering deferring an elective from the second to the third term, be sure to ​meet with your ​Student Success Advisor at least two weeks prior to registration.

Reach out to your Student Success Advisor if you have questions.

Financial Aid & Billing Reminders

Your bill will not be generated until after you register for classes. The billing due date will be listed in CalCentral.

Students interested in federal loans and/or federal work-study to help fund their education must complete a 
FAFSA for the appropriate academic year
.

To receive federal financial aid
, you must be enrolled in a 
minimum of 6 units
. This means 5th Year MIDS students are not eligible for federal financial aid in the summer semester.

If you are receiving financial aid or scholarships and have completed all required forms and tasks, funds will be disbursed by the tuition deadline for each term.

For fall and spring semesters, eligible students can enroll in the UC Berkeley 
Fee Payment Plan (FPP)
 to pay their bill in five installments. (
FPP is not available for summer semesters.
) Students are not able to enroll until their tuition & fees are assessed, and students must enroll by the deadline.

A 
late registration fee of $150
 is charged to all students who are not officially registered by the registration deadline; check the 
MIDS Academic Calendar
 for each semester’s registration deadline. To be officially registered, students must be enrolled in at least one class, pay 20% of their tuition & fees, and have no holds on their registration.

Having an outstanding bill after the third week of instruction can also cause a hold to be placed on a student’s account that can block class registration in the following term.

Registering For Classes

Enroll in 
required 5th Year MIDS classes
 once your enrollment window opens.

For core classes: Be sure to enroll in 5th Year MIDS sections of DATASCI 200, 201A, 203, 205, 207, and 210A. 5th Year MIDS sections are numbered 97–99.

Do not register or waitlist for sections that you are not able to attend.

Set up an automatic section swap 
in CalCentral. A swap allows you to enroll into an open section, waitlist for your preferred section time, and indicate that you should be dropped automatically if space becomes available in your preferred section. Review instructions for 
how to set up a swap
 and 
when to set up a swap
. Tip: set up your swap immediately after enrolling in an open section so that you are added to the waitlist right away. Waitlist positions cannot be retroactively changed should you decide to set up a swap later.

Arrange a manual swap
 on a peer-to-peer basis via Slack. Student Affairs can process one-on-one swaps, but we cannot initiate manual swap requests on behalf of students. Both students must already be registered for different sections of the same course in order to arrange a manual swap.

Drop extra elective courses you don’t plan to take as soon as possible.

After Registering for Electives (Second and Fourth Terms Only)

When enrolling in DATASCI elective courses in your second and fourth terms, add yourself to waitlists of classes you want to take so that program staff have the most accurate picture of student interest. In the event that sections need to be added, existing waitlists will be used to fill new sections, with priority based on timestamps.

After the last priority group registers, program staff audits and evaluates all waitlist enrollment, potentially adding sections of elective courses or making other adjustments.

Access to course content opens about two weeks before the start of instruction; historically enrollment in elective courses shifts around this time, and students can expect to see movement off of class waitlists.

Instruction begins and enrollment continues to shift up until the 
add/drop deadline
 at the end of the second week of instruction.

Summer Semester Reminders

There is 
no fee remission
 for ASE or GSR positions in the summer semester.

Students must be enrolled in a 
minimum of 6 units 
to be eligible for Federal Financial Aid. Since 5th Year MIDS students are strongly encouraged (but not required) to pursue a full-time internship during the summer while enrolled in the 1-unit DATASCI 293 practicum course, students are not eligible for Federal Financial Aid in the summer.

The Fee Payment Plan (FPP) is not an available option during the summer semester.

Additional Reminders

Review the refund schedule on the 
MIDS & MICS Withdrawal Refund
 page if you need to withdraw from all classes for the semester.

Review the 
SHIP waiver deadlines
 for the upcoming semester.

If you have any questions or concerns in the course of the registration process please reach out to your Student Success Advisor.
