** During the summer term, IREF (the Instructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee) and the health insurance (SHIP) fee are charged only to first-term students or students who were on a leave of absence during the preceding spring.

*** Students have the option to waive the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) if they have other major medical health insurance that meet the 
SHIP waiver criteria
 and don't wish to have dual coverage. For waiver qualifications, instructions, forms, and FAQs, please see 
Waiving SHIP
.

The tuition, fees, and charges displayed here reflect the currently approved amounts. These figures may not be final. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by State funding reductions. Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown. Students should expect fees to increase moderately each fall term.

Students are eligible to enroll in the Fee Payment Plan (FPP) for the Fall and Spring terms. Please refer to the 
Fee Payment Plan on the billing website
 for details and deadlines. FPP is not an option for Summer terms.

State-specific refund policies may apply in Maryland and Oregon. Students located in one of these states should contact the Student Affairs team for advising and billing assistance.

For additional information on the cost of attendance, please visit 
Financial Aid and Scholarships Office Cost of Attendance
.

Residency

California residents and nonresidents pay the same tuition and fees for the MIDS program, as it is a fully online program.

MIDS students are not eligible for student visas, as the program is fully online and does not require residency. International students may need to obtain short-term visas in order to attend the on-campus Immersion program, and students are responsible for making all necessary travel and visa arrangements.

Funding Your Education

Financial Aid

For financial aid advising, please contact Berkeley’s 
Financial Aid and Scholarships office
. Note that federal financial aid is limited to US citizens and permanent residents and may carry additional registration or other requirements. Notably, students must register in a minimum of 6 units per term in order to be eligible for federal financial aid.

Fellowships

The I School awards a variety of fellowships to I School students.

List of I School fellowship opportunities

MIDS students may also wish to explore employer sponsorship and tuition reimbursement options, as well as 
external fellowships
. Veterans may wish to consult the 
Cal Veteran Services Center
 regarding tuition benefits for student veterans.

Academic Student Employment

5th Year MIDS students who wish to pursue UC Berkeley Academic Student Employment opportunities — Graduate Student Researcher (GSR), Graduate Student Instructor (GSI), Tutor, or Reader positions — must be registered students in good academic standing and meet all applicable requirements. Please refer to the Graduate Division’s 
GSI, GSR, Reader, and Tutor Guide
 for further information.
