MIDS Capstone Project Pages

The I School website supports student project pages and galleries, to showcase the range of interesting projects you've been working on.

The site will automatically generate a personal gallery for every student in the project group, showcasing all of your projects. And if the projects are from a class, it will automatically generate a gallery of all the projects from that course.

How to Create a Capstone Project Page

One team member should set up the project web page:

Create project web page

Required fields:

Project title

Names of all project participants (
including yourself!
)
: The project will automatically show up in the gallery of all team members with I School profiles. (See note: 
Project Pages & Profile Privacy
)

Course
: Be sure to select your year, semester, and section of Data Science 210, to make sure your project shows up in the class gallery.

Date
: The date isn't displayed, but is used for sorting lists.

Description
: A full project description. Please include:

Problem & Motivation

Data Source & Data Science Approach

Evaluation

Key Learnings & Impact

Acknowledgements

Teaser text
: A short (140-character) project description, to be displayed in the project gallery. Longer text will be truncated, spo please keep it brief. The "Teaser Text" will 
not
 be displayed on the main project page, so you may want to duplicate text from the full description.

Teaser image*
: This will be the primary thumbnail image in lists and on gallery pages. (On lists and gallery pages, the teaser image will be displayed cropped square.)

Downloadable files
: Under "Attachments", upload project report(s) and/or other documents. After uploading the file, enter the file name or description, to be displayed on the page:

Final presentation slides in PDF format 
(required)

Additional files, as appropriate 
(optional)

Web links
: Enter the URL of any external project page(s) or prototype(s) to be linked from the page.

Link to project webpage 
(required)

Link to GitHub repository 
(optional)

Additional links 
(optional)

Optional fields:

Banner image*:
 displayed across the top of the page. (Banner images that are too tall will be automatically cropped to a 3:1 aspect ratio for display.)

Additional images*:
 displayed in the sidebar. After uploading the image, you may enter a description, which will be displayed as the image caption.

Pull quotes:
 text for the page sidebar

Video:
 Upload video to your own YouTube or Vimeo account and add the URL to the page.

University of California policy
 requires that all videos embedded on or linked from UC websites must be captioned.

After entering this information, click "Save" at the bottom of the page.

* If any images include text, you 
must
 enter that text as the ALT text after uploading the image.

Full Project Websites or Prototypes

If your project involves a live prototype or other interactive elements, you will need to post those pieces elsewhere:

The school is happy to provide you a group folder and web directory; more info is at 
Intranet › Computing › Files & Connecting › Group Folders
. Just email 
help@ischool.berkeley.edu
 to request the folder.

You are also welcome post it on your personal web site or some other website.

Whichever you choose, be sure to provide a link from your project description page, under "Files & Links > More Information".

Updating Existing Projects

The team member who initially created the project page will be able to return to edit the project information any time. Just log in to the site, navigate to your project page, and look for the "Edit" link in the top right corner of the page.

If you have problems or need assistance, please contact webmaster Jonathan Henke at 
webmaster@ischool.berkeley.edu
.

Personal Project Gallery

When you create a project page, a personal project gallery is automatically created for every project participant and is automatically linked from each person’s profile. No additional steps are required.

Your personal gallery page includes all the projects that list you as a participant, including your MIDS capstone project, sorted in reverse chronological order.

Capstone Project Galleries

If you correctly selected your year and semester of Data Science 210, your project will automatically be added to the course project gallery. The project gallery is 
linked from the course description, at the bottom of the sidebar.

In addition, your project will be added to your semester’s 
capstone project gallery
. The webmaster has to add it here manually, so it may not show up for a day or so. If it's still missing a day later, feel free to email 
webmaster@ischool.berkeley.edu
.

Project Pages & Profile Privacy

Feel free to link to the profiles of all participants — even those with private profiles. Project pages will respect the profile privacy settings of each project participant. If a participant’s profile is set to private, their name will be hidden from the project page when the viewer is not logged in to the site, but will be visible when the viewer is logged in.

FAQ

Why does one teammate’s name not show up on the page?

The people list on project pages respects each person’s profile privacy settings. If a teammate has set their profile to private, their name will display on the page when you are logged in, but will not be displayed when the viewer is logged out.

I just updated my project title, logo, or description; why does the project listing display the old information?

For performance reasons, all the project listings are cached, including final & capstone project lists, class project lists, and personal project galleries. This means that once you’ve updated your project, it might take as long as several hours before the listing is updated.

I added a description; why isn't it showing up on the project listing?

The blurb on the project listing page is taken from the field “Teaser Text” not “Description”. “Teaser Text” is displayed on the summary list but not on the page itself; “Description” is displayed on the page itself but not the summary list.

Why doesn't my project show up on this semester’s 
capstone project gallery
? 

Although the project is automatically added to the course gallery, the webmaster has to add it to the 
capstone project gallery
 
manually, so it may not show up for a day or so. If it's still missing after a day or two, feel free to email 
webmaster@ischool.berkeley.edu
.
