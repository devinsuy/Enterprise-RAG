Data Science 205 Waiver Exam

Students often come into the MIDS program with experience in data engineering equivalent to the objectives of the Data Science 205 course. In light of this, we are now offering a waiver of Data Science 205 to students who can demonstrate an equivalent to the minimum knowledge of the objectives of Data Science 205.

It is important for students to understand that 205 serves as a prerequisite to the following courses:

Data Science 210. Capstone

Data Science 221. Modern Data Applications 
(previously or concurrently)

Data Science 255. Machine Learning Systems Engineering

Data Science 261. Machine Learning at Scale

Students receiving the waiver must understand that 210, 255, and 261 will expect students to know all of the 205 materials. The waiver exam cannot possibly test an entire semester of material, so students receiving the waiver must agree that they will be held 100% accountable for all 205 material, regardless of whether or not it was included in the waiver exam.

Students receiving the waiver must ensure that their knowledge is sufficient such that they will not negatively impact the other students in 209, 255, and 261, neither in class, nor in office hours, nor in questions, nor in group projects, etc.
