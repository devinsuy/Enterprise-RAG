MIDS Tuition & Fees

Starting in the Fall 2024 semester, all MIDS students must have health insurance that meets the University’s criteria. Students will be automatically enrolled in and charged for the UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) to meet this requirement. In order to opt out of UC SHIP, students must have other medical health insurance that meets all of the 
waiver criteria
 and must complete an 
online waiver application
 by the specified deadline. The cost of SHIP in the 2023–24 Academic Year (Fall 2023, Spring/Summer 2024) is $3,078 per semester (Fall and Spring/Summer) or $6,156 per year. The 2024–25 SHIP fee will be announced in July 2024.

Estimated total tuition and fees for the degree for a new student starting Fall 2023 are currently 
$81,633
, not including health insurance; most students complete the degree in approximately two years. The exact amount of tuition and fees may depend on a variety of factors including number of semesters enrolled, whether students are enrolled in summer terms, and future fees or increases determined by the UC Regents.

Tuition & Fees

Fees are subject to change each academic year; new fees typically take effect in the fall term.

** During the summer term, IREF (the Instructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee) is charged only to first-term students or students who were on a leave of absence during the preceding spring.

*** Students have the option to waive the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) if they have other major medical health insurance that meet the 
SHIP waiver criteria
 and don't wish to have dual coverage. For waiver qualifications, instructions, forms, and FAQs, please see 
Waiving SHIP
.

The tuition, fees, and charges displayed here reflect the currently approved amounts. These figures may not be final. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by State funding reductions. Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown. Students should expect fees to increase moderately each fall term.

For additional information on the cost of attendance, please visit 
Financial Aid and Scholarships Office Cost of Attendance
.

Total Estimated Tuition and Fees

Total tuition and fees will vary depending on how many terms the student is enrolled, how many courses the student takes per term, and whether or not the student has existing health insurance that meets all of the University’s criteria. These estimates reflect current tuition and fees and do not include the cost of the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). (Based on the current fee, the estimated SHIP cost is $6,156 per year.). Fees are subject to change each academic year; new fees typically take effect in the fall term.

Refunds after Withdrawal

Students who have enrolled in classes and/or paid fees and do not plan on taking any courses that term must officially withdraw, and should review 
the Registrar’s policies on withdrawal, cancellation, and re-enrollment
. Students who need to withdraw for one or more terms should reach out to Student Success for the appropriate advising and policy guidelines. All cancellations or withdrawals must be approved by the School of Information Senior Director of Student Affairs. All current and future classes in which the student is enrolled will be dropped from their schedule after the withdrawal is approved by I School Student Affairs. The student will no longer be eligible to attend classes until re-enrolled.

The student may receive a partial refund of tuition and fees, depending on the date of the withdrawal.

Students utilizing financial aid should contact the financial aid office to understand potential impacts of a withdrawal.

Refund Schedule

Because MIDS & MICS follow their own academic calendar, this refund schedule may be different than on-campus degree programs.

Before the first day of instruction

100% refund

From the first day of instruction through the middle of the 7th week of instruction

Partial refund. (The exact refund amount depends on the day of withdrawal.)

Middle of the 7th week of instruction or later

No refund.

State-specific refund policies may apply in Maryland and Oregon. Students located in one of these states should contact the Student Affairs team for advising and billing assistance.

For the official policies, see 
the registrar’s Refunds after Withdrawal page
