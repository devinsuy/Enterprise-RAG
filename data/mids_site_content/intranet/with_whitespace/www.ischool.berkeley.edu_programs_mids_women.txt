Women in MIDS

The Women in MIDS initiative supports women in the program in a variety of ways.

We host focused discussions for women in the program — including faculty, students, and alumni — about their experiences in the program and their respective fields/professional domains. We also host occasional online meetings as well as a designated discussion channel on Slack.

The initiative also helps women in the MIDS program meet potential mentors by inviting women both inside and outside of the program to share their career experiences and insights in webinars and panel discussions. We also provide feedback to MIDS faculty, staff, and course developers about challenges and concerns faced by women in the program, to further the program’s inclusivity, improve faculty instructional strategies, and welcome diverse perspectives in the classroom.
