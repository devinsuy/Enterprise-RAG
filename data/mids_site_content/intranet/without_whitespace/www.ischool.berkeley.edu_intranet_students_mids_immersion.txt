The answer is different for different students and there are many factors to consider. We recommend you consult with the MIDS Career Advisor, Laurie Haskell-Woerner, about how Immersion attendance might relate to your job search timeline. We also recommend you reach out to your Student Support counselor to discuss how the program is going for you and when you feel you will get the most out of the Immersion activities. Above all, you should plan to complete Immersion before the end of your Capstone course, since Immersion participation is a graduation requirement. An Academic Event A reminder that the Immersion Program is an academic event and a MIDS degree requirement. As such, only registered students will be permitted to attend scheduled events for the week. We expect that students will engage and participate in all scheduled events for the week. International Travel If you require a formal letter of invitation for visa purposes in order to attend an in-person Immersion Program, please complete the Travel Invitation Request form .
