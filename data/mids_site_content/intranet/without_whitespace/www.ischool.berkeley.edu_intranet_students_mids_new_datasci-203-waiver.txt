Data Science 203 Waiver Exam The place-out waiver process for DATASCI 203 is for students who have very strong existing statistical knowledge. Please note that DATASCI 203 provides a helpful refresher and a great opportunity to work with students in your cohort during the first term. Thus, the opportunity to place out of the course is solely reserved for those students who truly do not need any review or a refresher on core fundamentals of statistics, such as the mechanics of hypothesis testing, operational definitions, data preparation and graphics in R, inferential bivariate statistics, principles of multiple regression, and regression diagnostics using R. For those who are very confident that they should not take DATASCI 203, the place-out exam is provided during the weeks before your first semester in the program. Self-Evaluation: Required Skills Before attempting the waiver exam, students should evaluate their individual abilities against the course learning objectives for DATASCI 203 . The waiver exam tests mastery of these objectives. DATASCI 203 Course Learning  Objectives Exam Availability Schedule (for Summer 2024) The exam will be open: Friday, February 23, 12:01 am PT – Sunday, March 31, 9:00 pm PT Once you start the exam, you will have 48 hours to complete the exam. (For example, if you start the exam at noon on March 20, it will be due at noon on March 22.) Final due date Regardless of when you begin your exam, it must be turned in no later than Sunday, March 31 at 9:00 pm PT . (If you start the exam after Friday, March 29 at 9:00 pm, you will have less than 48 hours to complete the exam before the final due date!) How the Exam Will Work When you register for the exam using the form below, we will email you instructions for accessing and completing the online exam. There is a 48-hour time limit. It is up to you when you want your 48 hours to begin. The time limit begins once you click the “Start Assignment” button on the online exam. This is an open-book exam. You may only take the exam once. Please do not share the exam materials with anyone. The waiver exam is based on homework and lab assignments from the course. The exam includes short answer items, mathematical exercises that require you to write proofs, and one larger data analysis that asks you to compose a statistical analysis in response to a research question. Your submission must represent your individual work. If you rely heavily on Google or other resources to complete and pass the waiver exam such that it is not an accurate representation of your abilities, you will likely struggle in areas of the program and in other courses. Please note it is OK if you're unable to complete the exam. Our goal is to ensure alignment between your background and whether you're a suitable candidate to waive out of this course. And if that is not the case, or you feel that you’d be better served by enrolling in this course — that should be considered a normal outcome for this exam. Next Steps To place out of DATASCI 203, you must receive at least a B– on this place out exam (a point total greater than 80%). To both place out of DATASCI 203 and be approved to take DATASCI 271 (an advanced course with DATASCI 203 as a prerequisite), you must receive at least a A– on this place-out exam (a point total greater than 90%) and receive instructor approval in advance. Additionally, you must complete the data analysis section using R. Waiving out of the 203 class does not waive you out of those 3 units needed to complete the program. Rather, it is an opportunity for you to use those units in another advanced course in a future term. If you do pass the exam and are eligible to waive out of 203, we will follow up to help you find a replacement course this semester, on a space available basis. We recommend that you enroll, or remain enrolled, in 203 until you have your result.
