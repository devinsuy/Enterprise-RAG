Careers in Data Science 

By merging computer science and statistics, two related but distinct disciplines, data science can transform troves of data into valuable insights and predictions. It permeates our everyday lives well beyond the tech world. Those with data science jobs are making strides in different industries, equipping businesses with the information they need to meet goals and develop solutions — even in times of crisis. 

From healthcare to retail and financial services, there are now growing opportunities across various industries and organizations for people who want to pursue careers in data science, provided they have relevant, up-to-date qualifications. 

In the evolving landscape of data science, professionals armed with both technical and statistical skills can help navigate challenges and drive innovation across sectors. From understanding consumer behavior to advancing medical research, data scientists play a pivotal role in decision making, problem solving, and helping organizations gain a competitive edge.

Data Science Career Paths

Why data science? The career pathways within this discipline are wide-ranging and diverse. In addition to traditional titles such as data engineer, data analyst, and data scientist, those pursuing a career in data science may leverage their skills and expertise in marketing, finance, accounting, operations, or supply chain in specialized departmental analytics. Data science professionals might also hold other job titles such as functional analyst, data systems developer, and analytical manager. 

Data science jobs are particularly relevant in the following industries: 

Automotive, aerospace, supply chain, and transport
Aviation, travel, and tourism
Chemistry, advanced materials, and biotechnology
Consumer
Energy utilities and technologies
Financial services and investors
Global health and healthcare
Information and communication technologies
Infrastructure
Mining and metals
Oil and gas
Professional services. 

Depending on factors like employer, budget, and demand, professionals may have opportunities to grow and expand within the field. Pursuing a data science career path has the potential to open doors to management roles where professionals can design diverse, resilient, high-performing teams from the ground up. 

Data science is also a multidisciplinary field that stresses the importance of statistics and mathematics alongside project management and communication. Data science involves more than just numbers; it’s about telling a compelling story. While each role calls for its own set of skills and on-the-job requirements, data scientists can build their knowledge base through advanced degree programs like a master’s in data science.

Why Data Science?

Still wondering why you should pursue a career in data science? There are several reasons, two of them being your impact and career outlook. 

When considering a career in data science, exploring the definition of the role can be helpful. Analytical powerhouse

 describes those in the data science profession as “a new breed of analytical data expert who has the technical skills to solve complex problems — and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved.” 

Working at the helm of mathematics, computer science, and market trends, they spend their time extracting, refining, and analyzing data to help advance causes, increase efficiency, and even improve quality of life. Often, their work goes beyond a single organization. Data scientists can have a far-reaching impact in multiple industry verticals, from healthcare to politics. 

Data science professionals can help address challenges like climate change by developing complex climate models that simulate how the Earth’s climate system responds to various factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and land use changes. They can also greatly benefit the medical field. By gathering patient data through the appropriate channels, data science professionals contribute to enhanced healthcare. Physicians, health insurance entities, and healthcare institutions all depend on data insights to make informed decisions about patients’ care.

Overall, data science is changing the world for the better. Preparing for a career in this field doesn’t necessarily begin or end with undergraduate studies. For some aspiring professionals, pursuing postgraduate education may be one of a few steps to becoming a data scientist. The UC Berkeley School of Information (I School) offers an online 
Master of Information and Data Science
 degree program that delves into the core principles of research design, data cleansing, machine learning, experiment and causal inference, and more. The program design is rooted in the school’s commitment to growing the world’s next generation of leaders who’ll use data for good, identifying opportunities to problem-solve, transform communities, and make meaningful contributions in the long term.
