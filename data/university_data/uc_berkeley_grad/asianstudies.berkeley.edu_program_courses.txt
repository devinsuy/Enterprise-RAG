ASIANST 201 Asian Studies Proseminar 1 Unit

Terms offered: Fall and Spring

This 1 unit course is required of all first-year graduate students and is supervised by a regular faculty member. The fall seminar will familiarize newly arrived students with Berkeley’s faculty and resources in Asian Studies, introduce methodologies particular to the field, and encourage students to develop their critical thinking, research, and writing skills. The spring semester is a workshop focusing on the art and craft of academic writing and thesis preparation.  

ASIANST 299 Independent Study 1 – 7 Units

Independent Study units are taken with specific faculty when doing further research in a field of inquiry, drafting your thesis, or research and writing. Although Independent Study units can be taken at any time, students will have often completed required coursework prior to doing Independent Study. Students should discuss the substance of these units with that particular faculty member. To register for a 299, you may send an email to the faculty member and the GSAO formally requesting the Independent Study.
