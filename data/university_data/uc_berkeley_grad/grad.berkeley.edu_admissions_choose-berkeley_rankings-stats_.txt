Student Funding
Sources of financial support for graduate students (2022 – 2023)

Most admitted doctoral students are funded in full for the majority of their study. In some cases that funding includes teaching and research appointments which are covered by collective bargaining agreements and come with many benefits of employment.

Funding packages

Berkeley offers multi-year funding packages to most entering doctoral students, 
including those who will enhance the diversity of the graduate student population. Recipients are selected by their departments at the admissions stage.

Multi-year packages 
typically
 include:

2 years of fellowship funding

2-3 years of departmental funding: combination of GSI (teaching) or GSR (research) appointments and/or fellowship

and/or 1 year of Doctoral Completion Fellowship*

Departmental funding often includes funding from a variety of sources, including university fellowships, departmental fellowships, training grant awards, GSI (teaching) appointments, and GSR (research) positions. Note that GSI and GSR positions, and all terms and conditions of employment, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

External multi-year fellowships, 
such as the NSF GRFP, NDSEG (DoD), Hertz, and others, are integrated into departmental funding packages.

*The Doctoral Completion Fellowship 
provides one year of fellowship funding to students in certain Humanities and Social Science disciplines, for use after advancement to doctoral candidacy.
