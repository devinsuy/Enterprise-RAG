About Graduate Tuition and Fees
Our 
Office of the Registrar website
 (opens in a new tab)
 has a detailed break-down of fees, depending on which type of graduate degree you’re pursuing.

The tuition, fees, and charges are estimates based on currently approved amounts. These figures are not final. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by state funding reductions. Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown.

Fees include student services fees, tuition, campus fee, class pass transit fee, health insurance, nonresident fees (if applicable), document management fees and other fees related to your specific type of degree.

Beyond tuition, you’ll need to factor in supplies and lab fees and also be aware that several professional degree programs are subject to different tuition and fee schedules.

The cost of living in the Bay Area, which is significantly higher than the national average, is balanced by the considerable advantages of attending a world-class institution in proximity to vibrant hubs of innovation. While your personal expense budget (including housing, food and transportation) is up to you, you can expect to pay upwards of 
$28,000 or more per year
 (opens in a new tab)
.

But don’t be put off. 
Financial aid, fellowships and teaching appointments can reduce these costs and cover the cost of tuition and fees for many Berkeley graduate students. The Graduate Division can help you navigate your funding options.
