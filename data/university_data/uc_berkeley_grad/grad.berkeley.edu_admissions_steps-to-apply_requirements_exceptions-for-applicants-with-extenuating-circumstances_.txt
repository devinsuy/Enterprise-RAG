Berkeley Graduate Student Profile

The faculty and staff of UC Berkeley understand that exceptional circumstances may arise that make it difficult to complete the university’s graduate application on time, including:

Natural disasters

Political or civil unrest

Pervasive network/power outages

Here are some flexible options and exceptions to help you complete your application:

I am unable to submit my application by the application deadline.
If you need an extension in submitting your application, please reach out to 
your department
 directly. Graduate Admissions does not manage deadline extensions.

I am unable to take the GRE or TOEFL exam before the application deadline.
Enter a future test date in your online application. If you will be delayed in taking your test after the deadline, contact 
the department
 to which you are applying and their staff can assist you. Let the department know you are seeking an exception due to extenuating circumstances.

Can recommenders send letters after the application deadline?
Yes, recommenders may upload letters after the deadline. Letters must be uploaded through our online application portal. We do not accept mailed letters. 
Contact 
your department
 if you know your recommenders may miss the deadline due to circumstances beyond their control.

What if I don't have my official transcript by the deadline?
Unofficial transcripts can be uploaded with your application. If you are offered admission to graduate study, you will be required to submit official transcripts.

Do you offer application fee waivers?
Need-based fee waivers are available. Please see our 
fee waiver
 page to determine if you qualify. The form to request a fee waiver is included in the payment section of the online application. To be considered, applicants should select the fee waiver payment option and upload all required supporting documents before submitting their online application.

Please contact 
your department
 directly if you need clarification or additional assistance.
