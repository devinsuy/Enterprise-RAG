General Information

										How many people apply each year?
										
Berkeley Law receives 5,000-6,500 applications in a typical year. See our 
Entering Class Profile
 for the exact number for the prior year. 

										What is the size of the first-year class? 
										
Between 300-325 students enter the law school each August. They are assigned to one of nine first-year modules (groups of about 35 students). During the first semester of the first year, two courses are taught in classes of about 100 students; one course is a small class of approximately 35 students; Legal Writing and Research has approximately 15-20 students.

										What are the median LSAT score and GPA of admitted applicants? 
										
For the past several years the median GPA and LSAT score of admitted applicants have ranged from 3.70-3.82 and 166-169, respectively. The ranges are broad. The Berkeley Graduate Division requires that graduate students have at least a 3.00 undergraduate cumulative GPA for admission. Exceptions can be made for very promising applicants. We review applications carefully and in their entirety.

										When is the application deadline?
										
The deadline to apply for admission as a first-year student is February 15. Early decision applicants must apply by November 15. 

The deadline to apply as a transfer student from another law school is June 1.  

										Does it matter when I apply?
										
Although our application deadline is February 15, we begin to read completed files as early as September. We recommend that you submit your application as early as possible, between September 1 and December 1.

Early decision applicants must apply between September 1 and November 15.

										Do you have any type of online program that would enable a working adult to earn a J.D. through your program? 
										
We only offer a full-time, three-year program that leads to the J.D. degree. There are no summer courses nor online or part-time programs.

										Can I apply to the JD program if I already have an LLM degree?
										
Yes, you may apply to the JD program if you already hold an LLM degree. We do not accept transfer credits from LLM degree programs, so you will be expected to complete the full, 3 year curriculum.

										Do you accept international students?
										
Yes. If you are an international applicant to the J.D. program who has earned an undergraduate degree from an institution outside of the United States or Canada, then you must have your records evaluated through the Law School Admission Council’s 
Credential Assembly Service (CAS)
 (opens in a new tab)
. An evaluation will be completed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) and will be incorporated into your CAS report. More time is usually required to receive foreign transcripts. An undergraduate degree earned outside of the United States or Canada is acceptable for admission if it is determined to be equivalent to an American bachelor’s degree. 

The TOEFL is not required. However, you must take the LSAT, and comply with all of the other application requirements. 

										Does Berkeley Law grant fee waivers?
										
We will waive your application fee automatically when you apply if you are approved for an LSAC fee waiver.

We do not provide fee waivers in response to email inquiries. 

Application fee waivers also are available to current or former participants from any public service program (
e.g.
, Peace Corps, Teach for America, active or former members of the military, etc.); who are recipients of a meritorious fellowship (
e.g
., Fulbright, Truman, etc.); or who received a grant based on an educational or socioeconomic hardship (
e.g
., CYDL participant, Pell, Gates Scholar, etc.). Detailed information and the waiver request form are found 
here
. The fee waiver application opens September 1 and the deadline to submit a fee waiver application is January 1.

We also send waivers proactively based on candidate searches using the LSAC 
Candidate Referral Service (CRS)
 (opens in a new tab)
. If you have not already opted in to CRS, we highly recommend that you do so. It’s how law schools nationwide identify particular candidates, provide them information about the school, and encourage them to apply (which often includes sending fee waiver codes).

										How can I obtain an application?
										
The application form and instructions for first-year applicants become available online each year on September 1. You can access and submit the application form via the 
LSAC website
 (opens in a new tab)
. Although the application deadline is February 15, we strongly encourage applicants to apply as early as possible. 

										Is there any other literature available about the school?
										
Our 
Prospectus
 is available on 
our website.

										I would like to meet with an admissions counselor.

COVID-19 Updates

										How will the Admissions Committee view P/NP courses taken during Spring 2020?
										
We understand that most schools — the law school included — went to either mandatory or optional Pass/No Pass during Spring 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Admissions Committee will not view courses taken for Pass/No Pass during Spring 2020 negatively, nor do you need to include an addendum explaining the situation. The only caveat is if you did not pass one or more of our courses. In this case, we would recommend submitting an addendum to explain the “NP” grade.

										How will the Admissions Committee view a large gap in employment due to COVID-19?
										
If you have a large gap in your resume (3+ months), you will be prompted to provide an explanation in the application, and you are welcome to elaborate further in an addendum if you wish to do so. The Admissions Committee will not view a gap due to COVID-19 negatively, but it is helpful to have more context for a gap related to the pandemic.

										Will you be waiving the LSAT or GRE requirement?
										
The American Bar Association requires that law schools use a fair and reliable standardized test for admission. Unfortunately, we are not able to waive this requirement.

										Are there restrictions in place for visiting the law school?
										
If you plan to come for an in-person visit, please know that the expectation for anyone coming to campus as a visitor or invited guest is that you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and that you will comply with all masking requirements. The University of California system defines 
“full vaccination”
 (opens in a new tab)
 as having received both the initial vaccination and a booster.

It is strongly recommended that you wear a mask when indoors, regardless of vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated, a mask is required when indoors. KN-95 masks are available near most entrances to the Law School. Further, if you are observing a class or meeting with a member of the Admissions Team, you will be asked to wear a mask. 

Masks are optional in outdoor spaces.

Standardized Test

										How do I register for the LSAT or the GRE?
										
LSAT information and registration are available at the 
LSAC website
 (opens in a new tab)
. GRE information can be found on the 
ETS website
 (opens in a new tab)
. You should register for the test well in advance of the actual test date.

										How long are my scores valid?
										
We will accept any score reported by the LSAC or ETS, generally for five years.   

										Can I get a fee waiver for the LSAT or the GRE?
										
LSAT fee waivers are available on a financial-need basis directly from LSAC. You should act early by applying 
online
 (opens in a new tab)
.

For information about the GRE, please visit the 
ETS website.
 (opens in a new tab)

										How many times can someone take the LSAT or GRE?
										
Please refer to the 
LSAC Policy on Repeating the LSAT
 (opens in a new tab)
. If you are taking the GRE, visit 
ETS.
 (opens in a new tab)

										How do you view multiple standardized test scores?
										
We ask that candidates report all scores taken within the last five years for each exam. 

If you take the LSAT more than once, we will primarily consider the highest score when evaluating your candidacy. However, there is a standard error of measurement on the exam and there is not a statistically-significant difference between many scores. We do not assign a value to the number of times you took (or did not take) the test. All tests registered for and attempted are reportable, including no-shows, applicant cancellations, LSAC cancellations, and other indicators of tests taken without reportable scores.

For the GRE, we will primarily consider your “superscore” when evaluating your candidacy.

If you have a valid and reportable LSAT score it will be seen and it will be considered in our review, even if you wish to be considered with “only” a GRE score. That LSAT score will flow in automatically from LSAC through the CAS report and/or CAS updates. 
You may write an addendum to provide context for score and performance differences
. If you have a valid and reportable GRE score, we require you to send a score report to us (from ETS). Your GRE score(s) will be seen and considered alongside your LSAT score(s), even if you wish to apply with “only” the LSAT. We may consider your application incomplete without any/all applicable test scores.

										Should I take the LSAT or the GRE? Do you favor the LSAT over the GRE?
										
We consider both exams to be valid and reliable for admission purposes. We do not favor or consider the LSAT over the GRE. If you believe we should consider one score over the other, you can include an addendum with your application.

										Do I need to report my GRE scores even if I only want to apply with the LSAT?
										
Yes, applicants must report all valid scores (typically, all scores from the last five years are considered valid) from both the LSAT and GRE. 
 Your GRE score(s) will be seen and considered alongside your LSAT score(s), even if you wish to apply with “only” the LSAT. We may consider your application incomplete without any/all applicable test scores.

										Do you translate GRE scores to their LSAT equivalent?
										
No, we do not take a GRE score and calculate an LSAT “equivalent.” GRE scores will be evaluated, in combination with your overall academic record, as one indicator of future success in law school.

										Are some LSAT administrations harder than others?
										
No. All LSATs are constructed to be equal in difficulty regardless of when they are administered. LSAT scores are reported on a 120-180 point scale and can be compared across testing administrations and testing years. Test scores have the same meaning from one test administration to the next and from one year to the next as a result of a process called 
equating.
 When scores are equated, a given scaled score represents comparable ability regardless of when the student takes the test.

										What does the LSAT test?
										
The LSAT assesses the kinds of verbal reasoning skills that have been shown to be critical for success in law school. The current makeup of the test, Reading Comprehension, Logical Reasoning, and Analytical Reasoning question types, was reached through continual refinements to the test conducted over its long history with early input from law faculty. The first LSAT was administered in 1948.

										What is tested in each LSAT question type?
										
Reading Comprehension

Reading Comprehension questions assess the ability to read, with understanding and insight, examples of lengthy and complex materials similar to those commonly encountered in law school. Law school and the practice of law revolve around extensive reading of densely written and argumentative texts. This reading must be careful, distinguishing precisely what is said from what is not said. It involves comparison, analysis, synthesis, and application. It involves drawing appropriate inferences, and applying ideas and arguments to new contexts. Law school reading also requires the ability to grasp unfamiliar subject matter and the ability to process challenging material.

Logical Reasoning

Logical Reasoning questions assess the ability to analyze, critically evaluate, and complete arguments as they occur in ordinary language. Arguments are a fundamental part of the law and analyzing arguments is a key element of legal analysis. Training in the law builds on a foundation of basic reasoning skills. Law students must draw on these skills in analyzing, evaluating, constructing, and refuting arguments. They need to be able to identify what information is relevant to an issue or argument and what impact further evidence has on it. They need to be able to reconcile opposing positions and use arguments to persuade others.

Analytical Reasoning

Analytical Reasoning questions assess the ability to consider a group of facts and rules, and—using those facts and rules—determine what could or must be true. These questions require the test taker to organize given information and draw logically certain inferences (or deductive inferences) from that information. These skills are key components of the ability to think critically. The reasoning skills assessed in Analytical Reasoning parallel those involved in the kind of legal reasoning that is used in law school and the practice of law in understanding and organizing a set of conditions, rules, or regulations and initial conditions, and then proceeding to determine what could or must be the case given that information.

										Do I have to take an expensive test-prep course to do well on the LSAT or GRE?
										
Taking an expensive test-preparation course is not required to do well on the LSAT or the GRE. We advise all test takers to practice and to become familiar with the test prior to taking the either the LSAT or the GRE.

To help LSAT-test takers prepare, LSAC publishes thousands of test questions (with answer keys) that have appeared on previously administered LSATs. LSAC publishes thorough explanations of how to solve all the questions on several of these tests. These explanations are developed by the same LSAC test developers who write the test questions. Some of these materials are available for free on 
LSAC.org
 (opens in a new tab)
, others are available for purchase at low cost.

										How far in advance should a test taker prepare for a standardized test?
										
There is no single right answer to this question. Much depends on how much time the individual student has to prepare each week.  We generally advise people to prepare until they feel they have satisfied the following guidelines:

none of the question types that you see in your practice seem new to you

you feel you can manage your time well

working through a test section becomes “second nature”

										How important is the LSAT?
										
The LSAT score is an important admission factor. When combined with the undergraduate GPA, it provides the best indication of academic achievement and potential. You should retake the test only if you believe that your first score was atypical and that you can improve your score sufficiently to make a net gain. The majority of applicants take the test only once. If you take the test more than once we will use the highest score. We recognize that there is no statistical significance to a score gain or loss of a few points within the standard error of measurement of the test. No admissions decisions are made based solely on an LSAT score. We take many factors into consideration.

										What is the latest date I can take the LSAT or GRE?
										
We recommend that you plan to take the test as early as convenient and no later than the one offered in January to optimize your admission review for the following year. Because we operate on a rolling admissions basis, and applications are reviewed as they are submitted, we encourage you to take the LSAT no later than November, however we will accept the January score. LSAT scores are valid for five years and are reported automatically by LSAC. Scores older than five years are not reported.

Early decision applicants must take the LSAT no later than October of the year prior to their desired enrollment.

										Does doing well on the LSAT have anything to do with actual law school work?
										
The LSAT is the single best predictor of 
first-year law school grades
. The best overall prediction comes from combining LSAT score with undergraduate GPA. Admission officers use a combination of the LSAT and undergraduate GPA when making admission decisions. There is broad agreement in the legal education community that the skills assessed by the LSAT are directly relevant to law school and the practice of law.

										Can I apply before receiving my LSAT/GRE scores? What if I want to retake the LSAT/GRE after I've applied?
										
When you apply, you will be prompted to enter any dates that you have taken or plan to take the LSAT. If you register for a future test date (indicated in this application), we will 
automatically hold
 your application for review until we receive the new score from LSAC. If you do not wish for us to hold your application, it is your responsibility to email us and request we no longer hold your application. If we are holding your application and (after taking the future test) you decide to cancel that score, your application is still being held until the cancellation is reported unless you contact our office to request otherwise. If you did not plan to retake (and did not indicate a future test in the application) but then changed your mind, please note that we will consider your application complete unless you contact us and tell us to hold it.

Academic Record

										Will my CAS GPA be the same as the GPA calculated by my undergraduate school?
										
It is possible that your CAS GPA and your university GPA may differ. For example, if you took a class P/NP, but did not pass, then CAS will convert the NP to an “F” and recalculate your GPA accordingly.  Questions should be directed to the LSAC.

										Do I need to send foreign transcripts to CAS?
										
The CAS service will interpret and summarize records or transcripts from foreign institutions and will send the summary to us when you apply.

										Must I register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS)? 
										
Applicants are required to submit their transcripts to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) which administers the CAS, preferably as early as possible and no later than the end of December.

										Can I just send my transcripts to Berkeley Law?
										
No. LSAC, not Berkeley Law, must receive a copy of your transcript(s) directly from each college or university that you have attended even if the institution does not use a letter-grade system.

										What role does my GPA play in admissions?
										
According to weights provided by the law school, CAS will combine your LSAT score and your undergraduate grade point average into a single value called the index number and will print the index number on your CAS report. The report will include your undergraduate academic summary, LSAT score(s), copies of your transcripts, writing sample(s), and letters of recommendation. Your academic record plays a substantial role in our review process.

										I am in school now. Should I wait for my fall/winter grades to arrive before applying?
										
If you are currently completing your undergraduate degree, you should not wait for fall or winter term grades to be posted on your transcript before sending them to the LSAC. You can update your application by sending these grades to LSAC and emailing a copy to our office at admissions@law.berkeley.edu after they are released.

										Does your undergraduate school make a difference in getting accepted?
										
The rigor of individual undergraduate schools and majors is taken into consideration during the review process, but it is rare that the school from which an applicant graduated is the sole basis of a decision. We are interested in considering the accomplishments of human beings and not the schools they attended. The GPA and LSAT alone are not dispositive.

										Do I need a certain major to apply? Are some majors preferred over others?
										
We don’t require or look for a particular major. That said, the most represented majors in our entering class are political science, history, English, economics, international relations, philosophy, psychology, and biology. In general, we recommend that you major in something that you are genuinely interested in, not something that you think will increase your chances at admission.

Letters of Recommendation

										Whom should I ask to write a letter of recommendation?
										
You may submit up to 4 recommendations letters. Most applicants submit 2-3. They should be from academic sources who know you and your classroom work well. Ideally, each letter will provide comparative comments that distinguish you from your peers. Examples of academic sources include professors, teaching assistants, graduate student instructors, and thesis advisers. Letters from work supervisors or colleagues are acceptable if you have been out of school for some time (usually, 5 years or more). Letters from family friends, famous people, or relatives are not helpful.  

										How do I inform Berkeley Law how many letters I will send and from whom? What if that information changes?
										
There is a field on our application to indicate the names of your recommenders. Please notify us via 
email
 if you anticipate changes to that list after you have submitted your application.

										How do I submit my letters of recommendation?
										
Arrange to submit your letters through your CAS account. Your recommendations will be copied and sent to us electronically with your CAS report as part of your subscription. Follow the directions on the LSAC website to use this service.

										Am I required to waive my right to access letters of recommendation?
										
We give no weight to whether or not you have waived your right to access your recommendations.

										Do letters of recommendation have to be from the year that I am applying?
										
If you have letters that are a few years old, it would be a good idea to reach out to the original recommenders and give them an opportunity to update their letters with any new information; however, it is okay if the letters are from 1-2 years ago.

Review Process and Decisions

										Do in-state applicants have higher preference than those from out of state? 
										
You have an equivalent chance of being admitted regardless of your residency.

										Is Berkeley Law on a rolling admissions process?
										
We operate a rolling admission and notification process. It is slow and methodical because each file is reviewed and no numeric cutoff points are employed. It is helpful to apply as early as possible because we begin making offers as soon as we begin reading files in September. However, we don’t admit anyone who doesn’t meet our standards simply because they applied early, nor do we give any less consideration to those who apply later.

										Do you grant interviews?
										
The large number of applicants we receive each year precludes our conducting personal interviews.

										Does it help my admission chances if I take time off after college before applying to law school?
										
Applicants often take time off prior to law school to obtain work experience, to pay down educational debt, or to take a break from academia. We do not penalize applicants for doing so. In fact, more than 85 percent of our students worked or pursued other activities prior to attending law school. We seek interesting, engaged, and passionate individuals who are ready to take on three rigorous years of school. If you need a break from academia, it is best to take it before applying to law school.

										Is consideration given to diversity?
										
We strive to admit a diverse group of people to join the vibrant exchange of ideas and viewpoints in our classrooms. Our admission policy gives equal consideration to a variety of factors in addition to numerical indicators. These include graduate work, special academic distinctions, life experiences, difficulty of the academic program, work experience, history of overcoming educational or socioeconomic disadvantage, and significant achievement in nonacademic activities or public service.

										What are the most important things for the Admission Committee when reviewing applications?
										
Our review process is holistic and seeks to identify applicants who are bright, intellectually curious, centered, and who will make a contribution to the caliber of classroom dialogue. If hypothetical weights were assigned to the three factors considered – academic record, LSAT score, and personal statement and recommendations – each would be about one-third.

										Will I be given preference if I already am a lawyer from another country?
										
You will not be given preference in the J.D. admissions process if you already are a foreign-educated lawyer, nor should you assume that advanced standing credits will be awarded if you are admitted.

										Are all applications read? Is there a cutoff?
										
Each application is reviewed by the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid or by one of her associates. No applicant is automatically admitted or denied solely on the basis of test scores and grades. Some applicants are admitted immediately, while other competitive applications are sent to the Admissions Committee for additional individual evaluation. The Committee is composed of faculty members, law school staff, and current students who serve in an advisory capacity.

										When will I know the decision on my application?
										
The notification period is usually December through April. Early decision applicants are notified by December 7.

										If I am denied admission, may I appeal or be reconsidered?
										
All decisions are final. Applications are reviewed carefully on a comparative basis initially. Therefore, reconsideration after the conclusion of the process might create an unfair situation more favorable to the individual applicant. Such reconsideration would lack the perspective provided by the original comparison with other applications.

										If I am denied admission may I reapply?
										
Applicants are welcome to reapply and should follow the regular application instructions and register again with the CAS. Updated transcripts should be sent directly to LSAC, not to the law school.

										May I defer my admission?
										
Deferment requests are considered on an individual basis. It is best to apply in the year that you intend to enter law school. With sufficient reason deferments are granted to a limited number of admitted applicants.
