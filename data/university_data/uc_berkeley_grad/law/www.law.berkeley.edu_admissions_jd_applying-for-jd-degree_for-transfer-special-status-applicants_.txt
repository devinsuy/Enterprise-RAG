J.D. Admissions
 
Applying for the J.D. Degree
 
Transfer & Visiting Student Applicants
 
				Transfer & Visiting Student Applicants				

Advanced standing students come from law schools across the country and make a substantial and welcome contribution to Berkeley Law’s student body. Applicants are considered for the fall term only and admission decisions usually are made in late June or early July. The application filing period is April 15-June 15, but applicants are encouraged to submit complete applications as early as possible.

There are two categories of advanced standing, transfer and visiting status. Information about each category follows:

TRANSFER STUDENTS

Erik Kundu '19

									As a transfer student, Erik says getting involved in student journals and organizations helped him to quickly form community at Berkeley Law 								

 (opens in a new tab)

Kaylene Kholsa ’22

									Looking for better opportunities in her intended field, Kaylene transferred from the University of Colorado, Boulder								

 (opens in a new tab)

Transfer students come to Berkeley after their first year in a full-time JD program elsewhere, complete their last two years here, and then receive a Berkeley Law degree. When we review transfer applications, we focus on the applicant’s performance during the first year of law school. Admission is very competitive. We usually receive more than 200 applications for about 25-35 places in our second-year class, and successful transfer applicants usually come from the top 10 percent of their respective home law school classes. The exact number of transfer places available may vary from year to year.

Joining Journals

Although Berkeley Law has thirteen student-run 
law reviews and journals
, only one of them, the 
California Law Review (CLR)
, runs a write-on competition for transfer students in mid-July (you may join the other twelve simply by volunteering). This year, the competition will begin on Wednesday, July 5 and end on Saturday, July 15. Successful applicants will be expected to attend a 
CLR
 orientation. The date for orientation is still being determined but we will update Write-On participants as soon as it’s available. Any potential transfer student may take part in the write-on regardless of whether he or she has yet been accepted or committed to Berkeley Law.

Those who wish to participate should email 
CLR
 Senior Development Editor, 
Irania Marin
, 
by June 30, 2024
. In the body of the email, please provide the following information:

Your first, middle, and last name;

Preferred email address;

phone number; and

birth date

2L Summer Private Sector Job Search

Due to recent changes in law firm recruiting, we recommend that you continue to work with your current law school’s career advising office on your 2L summer private sector job search while your application to transfer is being reviewed. The timing of our transfer application allows you to participate in our Summer OCI program (“SOCI”), but many law firms will have already begun their recruitment efforts by this time. 

If you are admitted as a transfer student, you also should be aware that the bidding process for our Summer OCI program will take place July 17-22. Interviews will be conducted virtually on 
July 30, 31, and August 1
, and many second round interviews will take place over the following two weeks. If you miss the bidding deadline, you will not be able to participate in the lottery for SOCI. Therefore, if you are interested in working at a law firm for your 2L summer and would like to participate in SOCI, we strongly encourage you to meet with Berkeley Law’s Career Development Office as soon as possible after accepting our offer of admission to develop a strategy for your job search. Time is of the essence.

Requirements

A law student who has completed one year at another law school may apply for transfer status to enter the second-year class if:

Before law school, a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent was awarded by an approved college or university

The first-year curriculum was completed in a full-time program at a law school that is approved by the American Bar Association (we do not admit part-time students unless they have completed the entire first-year curriculum)

A minimum of 28 semester units was completed at the time of our review

The work for which transfer credit is sought is of very high quality

The student was not placed on probation nor disqualified.

A maximum of 32 units completed elsewhere will be accepted toward a Berkeley J.D. degree, although students who have completed more units may apply. Berkeley Law reserves the right to prescribe further conditions for granting of such credit.

If you are admitted as a transfer student and wish to enroll, you must commit in writing and withdraw your transfer applications from all other schools. In order to participate in Berkeley’s Early Interview Week, you must also certify that you are not participating, and will not participate, in any other law school’s on-campus interview program. A false certification will be considered a violation of the Student Honor Code.

Order of the Coif

The Order of the Coif is a national honor society for law school graduates who attended member schools. Each year it extends invitations to the top 10% of Berkeley Law’s graduating J.D. students by grade point average. No application is necessary, although students should make sure that their final transcripts are accurate. Third-year Berkeley Law students must have at least 75% of the total credits needed to graduate in graded courses. At a minimum, graduates must therefore have 64 graded credits by the end of their third year. Non-Berkeley Law and non-law courses are not counted into the GPA. Students who have obtained a substantial number of ungraded credits (through journal work, moot court participation, and the like) and who aspire to Coif membership should pay careful attention to the number of graded units they will have at the completion of their studies. Only graded courses are counted in determining final GPA. As students consider classes, they should keep in mind that some of our clinics are offered for credit/no credit, while others are offered for a grade. Students who would like to be eligible for Order of the Coif should pay close attention to which clinics they choose to take and any impact that decision might have on the total number of graded units they have. Students who spend a semester or two studying at an institution other than at Berkeley Law (
e.g
., Harvard Exchange, transfer, or joint degree students) should refer to the 
Registrar’s Order of the Coif
 webpage for their specific requirements.

Transfer Applicants Must Provide the Following:

An electronic application form through the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) submitted between April 15-June 15

The application fee is waived for transfer applicants.

A 2-4 page personal statement and a resume

CAS report from the LSAC

Two recommendations from
 your current law school professors. One letter should come from a professor who taught you in a doctrinal course, and the second letter should come from a Legal Writing and Research professor. 
Ideally, these should be included with your CAS report. Letters sent after submitting an application or after the deadline may be provided via email attachments to 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu

A home law school transcript, or an individual grade report that includes final spring term grades,
 sent directly to
 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu
. DO NOT send your law school transcript to the LSAC. We will accept a student copy of your spring term grades to expedite the review process, but a final official transcript must follow if you are admitted. 

Financial aid applicants should follow the instructions provided to first-year applicants, located 
here
.

									Frequently Asked Questions by Transfer Applicants									
			
										Is there anything I can do during my first year to enhance my transfer application?
										
Earn excellent grades during your first year. The predominant focus of our transfer review process is academic performance during the first year of law school.

										When should I apply? What is the deadline?
										
We accept transfer applications from April 15-June 15. Assuming you applied for first-year status last year, your LSAC subscription should still be active.

An early application is encouraged to ensure that all of your documents are processed expeditiously. Refer to the transfer checklist above for specific information on what you need to submit. 
Supporting documents (spring grades, recommendations, etc.) may arrive after our deadline, but be forewarned that almost all of our decisions will have been made by the second week in July.
 Admission decisions cannot be made until after spring grades are reported. You may email your spring grades to admissions@law.berkeley.edu. We will accept an unofficial copy for review purposes, but require an official transcript with both fall and spring grades to be sent to us as soon as possible.

										How many transfer applications are received? How many places are available?
										
We usually receive approximately 200 transfer applications each year. The number of places available in the second-year class varies from year to year.

										May part-time students apply?
										
We offer only a full-time program. By definition, transfer students are full-time, second-year students. Students who are enrolled in a part-time program do not have sufficient credits to transfer. Because our decisions are released in early July, it is not possible for part-time students who are enrolled in summer courses to apply in the same year.

										I attend a law school that is not approved by the American Bar Association. Can I apply?
										
We only accept transfer credits from law schools that are fully- or provisionally-approved by the American Bar Association.

										I am/was an LL.M. student. Can I transfer into the J.D. program?
										
Unfortunately, we do not accept transfer credits from LL.M. programs into our J.D. program.

										Does involvement in extracurricular activities (such as volunteering with a law-related nonprofit) as a 1L enhance my transfer chances?
										
Outside activities will enhance your chances if your first-year grades are also strong. Extracurricular activities do not substitute for strong academic performance.

										How high does my class rank need to be in order to transfer?
										
In general, successful transfer applicants usually come from the top 10 percent of their first-year classes.

										I did not take the LSAT for admission to my current law school. Can I still apply?
										
If you applied to law school using the GRE or GMAT instead of the LSAT, you are welcome to submit an application. 

										What should I highlight in my personal statement?
										
We recommend a 2-4 page personal statement in which you provide some insight on your background and your potential contribution to classroom dialogue and scholarly research. An indication of why you wish to transfer to Berkeley may be included, but it is not required. Please include a current resume.

										From whom should I get letters of recommendation?
										
We ask for two letters from first-year faculty members.
 One letter should come from a professor who taught you in a doctrinal course, and the second letter should come from a Legal Writing and Research professor. M
ore than two letters is discouraged.

										Are you able to get the classes you want considering that transfers sign up after all the other 2Ls?
										
In general, yes. The faculty reserves seats in their classes for new transfer students.

										How many units do you take the first semester at Berkeley Law?
										
This depends on the individual and on how many units are transferred in. We require 85 units to graduate; on average the unit load is 13-14 units.

										Can transfer students be on moot court teams or trial teams in their 2L year?
										
Yes.

										When does the write-on competition happen for journals?
										
Berkeley Law has thirteen student-run law reviews and journals. Students may join any twelve of them simply by volunteering upon your arrival. The exception is the 
California Law Review (CLR)
 which runs a write-on competition for transfer students. Details are noted above. Any potential transfer student may take part in the  
CLR
 write-on regardless of whether he or she has yet been accepted or committed to Berkeley Law.

										Are transfers welcomed at Berkeley Law?
										
Most definitely! In fact, transfer students not only integrate quickly but often become some of our top students.

										Do you have any general housing advice?
										
Because the transfer admission process concludes only about five weeks before classes begin, it is imperative that transfer students make their enrollment decision quickly. There are many housing resources available, both through the University’s Housing Office and from online services, like craigslist.com. We release all of our transfer admission decisions in early July. It is rare that new transfer students are without housing by the time we begin classes in August.

VISITING STUDENTS

We typically receive 25-30 applications for the five places available for visitors, who spend their third year at Berkeley and receive their law degree from their school of origin. Visitor status admission is available to students who have completed two years of high quality work at their home law school and who demonstrate a compelling need to spend their final year at Berkeley. Applicants are expected to explain their compelling need in the personal statement. Examples of compelling need may include a medical condition, a family emergency, or to be with a spouse. Visitor status is not granted to fulfill individual academic interests.

The applicant’s home law school must provide notice to accept work satisfactorily completed at Berkeley as credit toward the student’s law degree. In addition, second-year law students will be considered for visitor status only if:

Before law school, a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent was awarded by an approved college or university;

Two years of a law school curriculum were completed in a full-time program at an American Bar Association-approved law school;

The student was not placed on probation nor was disqualified.

The application filing period is April 15-June 15.

Visiting Status Applicants Must Submit the Following

An electronic application form through the LSAC between April 15-June 15

The application fee is waived for visiting status applicants.

A 2-4 page personal statement that includes the reason for requesting visiting status and a resume

Two recommendations from law professors sent directly to 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu

A letter from the home law school confirming acceptance of third-year coursework completed at Berkeley Law

A home law school transcript that includes second-year, spring-term grades

									Frequently Asked Questions by Visitor Status Applicants									
			
										When should I apply?
										
Visitor status applications may be submitted April 15-June 15. An early application is encouraged to ensure the timely processing of all documents. Supporting documents (
i.e.,
 spring grades and recommendations) may arrive after the deadline. Note that most of our decisions will have been made by early July.  Decisions cannot be made until after spring grades are reported. Time is of the essence. Applicants should email their spring grades to 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu
.

										How many applications for third-year visitors are received? How many places are available?
										
On average, we receive 20-25 applications for five visitor places. Admission is based almost solely on a compelling need to be at Berkeley.

										What should I highlight in my personal statement?
										
Visitor status applicants should discuss their compelling need to attend Berkeley Law in their personal statements. We recommend including a current resume.

										From whom should I get letters of recommendation?
										
We suggest two letters from faculty at your home law school.

										Do you have any general housing advice?
										
Because the admission process concludes about five weeks before classes begin, it is imperative that new admits make their enrollment commitment quickly. There are many housing resources available, both through the University’s Housing Office and through online services, like craigslist.com. We attempt to release all of our admission decisions by early July. It is rare that new students are without housing by the time we begin classes in August.
