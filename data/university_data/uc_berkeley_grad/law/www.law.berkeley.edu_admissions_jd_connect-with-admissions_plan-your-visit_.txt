Summer 2024 Hours
 
The Law School is open Monday-Friday during regular business hours.

From May 1 to 24, the JD Admissions Office is open Monday through Friday from 9am-12pm and 1pm-4pm. 
 
From June 3 to August 2, 
the JD Admissions Office is open on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 9am-12pm and 1pm-4pm. 
 
Due to holidays, office-wide events, and travel, we will be 
closed
 
on the following dates:
 
May 10, May 27-31, June 19, June 24-28, and July 2-4.

Advising Appointments
 
If you are a prospective applicant for the 2024-25 cycle (to begin law school in August 2025) and would like to meet with a member of our staff, you can 
make an appointment 
 (opens in a new tab)
for an in person or virtual meeting. Our summer appointments are available on select Mondays and Thursdays in June and July. Our fall appointment calendar will be published in September 2024.

Due to limited availability, if you are applying during a later cycle, we invite you to attend or watch an 
applicant information session
 or you may email us at 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu
 with any questions you have. Please familiarize yourself with our 
website
 before making an appointment as many answers can be found online. As a reminder, we do not take notes during these appointments, and this is not an interview for the JD program. Please refrain from making multiple appointments to allow others to access one-on-one advising.

In-Person Tours and Information Sessions
 
In-person information sessions and tours are paused until fall 2024, but we invite you to watch our latest 
recorded information sessions
. 

Looking for a Self-Guided Tour?
 
Stop by our office to pick up a 
Prospectus
 and instructions on how to take a 
self-guided tour
 of the Law Building. While our law students spend the bulk of their time within the Law Building, we also recommend taking a 
free, guided walking tour
 (opens in a new tab)
 of the main UC Berkeley campus during your visit (advanced registration is required).

Want some specific recommendations? We’ve compiled some of our favorites below:

Things to do 

									Frequently Asked Questions									
			
										Can I visit on a day that your office is closed?
										
Yes! You’re welcome to download the 
self-guided tour
 and explore the building on your own. If you have any questions before or after your visit, please feel free to contact us. 

										Where should I stay when I visit? How do I get to campus?
										
There are a number of lodging options close to campus. The closest hotels are the Faculty Club, Women’s Faculty Club, Bancroft Hotel, and the Graduate Hotel. A longer list of lodging options, prices, and distance from campus can be found 
here
 or 
here
 (opens in a new tab)
. Information about arriving from the airport, transportation, and parking can be found 
here
. 

										Do I need to be vaccinated before I can visit? Do I need to wear a mask?
										
If you plan to come for an in-person visit, please know that the expectation for anyone coming to campus as a visitor or invited guest is that you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and that you will comply with all masking requirements. The University of California system defines 
“full vaccination”
 (opens in a new tab)
 as having received both the initial vaccination and a booster.

It is strongly recommended that you wear a mask when indoors, regardless of vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated, a mask is required when indoors. KN-95 masks are available near most entrances to the Law School. 

Masks are optional in outdoor spaces.

										Can I schedule a meeting with an Admissions Counselor for my upcoming visit?
										
If you are a prospective applicant for the 2024-25 cycle (to begin law school in August 2025) and would like to meet with a member of our staff, you can 
make an appointment 
 (opens in a new tab)
for an in person or virtual meeting. Our summer appointments are available on select Mondays and Thursdays in June and July. Our fall appointment calendar will be published in September 2024.

Due to limited availability, if you are applying during a later cycle, we invite you to attend or watch an 
applicant information session
 or you may email us any questions. Please familiarize yourself with our 
website
 before making an appointment as many answers can be found online. As a reminder, we do not take notes during these appointments, and this is not an interview for the JD program. Please refrain from making multiple appointments to allow others to access one-on-one advising.

										How can I request accommodations for a visit or a class observation?
										
If you require an accommodation for effective communication (ASL interpreting/CART captioning, alternative media formats, etc.) or information about campus mobility access features in order to fully participate in a visit or a class observation, please contact Chelsea Hackett at 
chackett@law.berkeley.edu
 with as much advance notice as possible and at least 7-10 days in advance of the event.

										I'm an officer for my school's pre-law student group and would like to set up a visit for my group. Is this possible?
										
Please contact Alice Young, Director of Admissions for Outreach and Recruitment, at 
ayoung@law.berkeley.edu
 for any inquiries about Fall 2024. Please note that our ability to set up individual group visits is extremely limited, and we are unfortunately unable to accommodate all of the requests that we receive.
