Tuition & Fees
 
				Tuition & Fees				

Tuition and fees represent the direct financial obligations payable to the University of California, Berkeley. Typically, tuition fees undergo an annual increase ranging from 3% to 5%, with final adjustments determined by the Regents of the University of California in July. Please be aware that the officially approved tuition and fee amounts may deviate from the figures outlined below.

For the academic year 2024-25, the estimated J.D. tuition and fees are as follows:

California Resident: $63,196

Non-Resident: $75,624

Health Insurance: $6,442*

*Health insurance is compulsory for all UC students, and enrollment in the UC Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) is automatic. However, students have the option to retain SHIP or 
waive enrollment
 (opens in a new tab)
 if they possess alternative coverage meeting the University’s 
specified criteria
 (opens in a new tab)
.

2024-25 Academic Year Cost of Attendance

The Cost of Attendance (COA), often referred to as the “budget,” provides an estimation of educational expenses for the duration of enrollment, typically spanning the nine month academic year. It encompasses both billed expenses, such as tuition and fees, as well as estimated living expenses.

How to Pay for Tuition and Fees

Students can view their account balance through 
CalCentral
 (opens in a new tab)
 by logging in to CalCentral and selecting the “My Finances” tab at the top of the page. There, students can see their fees and due dates. To view more account information, click “View Transactions”.

										Making a Payment Online via CalCentral
										
You can follow the instructions below to make a payment online. For full details please visit the 
Payments & Refunds
 (opens in a new tab)
 web page.

Log In to CalCentral
 (opens in a new tab)

https://calcentral.berkeley.edu
 (opens in a new tab)

Click the ‘My Finances’ menu tab

From the CalCentral home page, click the ‘My Finances’ menu tab

Click the ‘Make Payment’ button

Navigate to the ‘Billing Summary’ section on the ‘My Finances’ page and click the ‘Make Payment’ button

										Fee Payment Plan (FPP)
										
The Fee Payment Plan (FPP) allows for qualified registration fees to be paid in five monthly installments. The FPP enrollment is established on a per-semester basis, not an academic year. When you enroll in the FPP, you will be required to pay a non-refundable participation fee of $60 (this fee is subject to change per semester). The non-refundable FPP participation fee will be due with the first installment. Please visit the 
Payments & Refunds
 (opens in a new tab)
 web page for detailed instructions on how to enroll in the FPP and refer to the 
Fee Payment Plan FAQ
 (opens in a new tab)
 if you have further questions.

										Third-Party Contract (TPC)
										
A third-party organization may sponsor a student’s enrollment by committing to paying a student’s mandatory tuition and registration fees. Most organizations will grant the sponsorships through an application process. Once the student recipients are identified, the organization will send the funds to the school along with award processing instructions.

If the organization requires that they be invoiced directly before issuing payment, the student may request that the campus accept a 
Third Party Contract
 (opens in a new tab)
. The Billing and Payment Services Office (BPS) coordinates Third Party Contracts (TPC).

										Financial Aid Refunds
										
If your financial aid payments exceed your charges, the extra funds will be issued to you as a refund about one week after payments are posted. Refunds are issued as early as the first week of each term. The actual timing of your refund depends on when your financial aid was applied to your account. Please check 
CalCentral
 (opens in a new tab)
 to monitor your aid payment dates so that you can estimate the date of any expected refund.

You will get an email letting you know when your refund is available either via 
direct deposit
 (opens in a new tab)
 or as a paper check. We strongly recommend you sign up for direct deposit since that is the fastest and safest way to receive your funds. If you do not have direct deposit, then a paper check will be mailed to your local address within 10 business days. Please make sure you review and update your local address information in 
Cal Central.
 (opens in a new tab)

Additional Information

										Residency and Financial Aid Awards
										
Until the Residency Office finalizes the newly admitted students’ residency statuses, their current Cost of Attendance and financial aid awards rely on self-reported data from the admissions applications. Any changes to the residency status will have implications for their Cost of Attendance as well as the amounts of financial aid for which they qualify.

Below are awards administered by the Law Financial Aid Office that are contingent upon the student’s residency status. If students hold any of the following awards and experience a change in residency status, it is crucial to contact our office to understand the resulting impact.

Berkeley Law Opportunity Scholarship

Public Interest Scholars

PDST Increase Offset Award (PIOA)

Examples:

You were a nonresident student and borrowed federal student loans up to the Cost of Attendance. Consider a scenario where the nonresident Cost of Attendance is $110,000 and the California resident Cost of Attendance is $80,000. If you received $30,000 in gift aid and borrowed $80,000 in federal student loans as a nonresident, your federal loans will be reduced to $50,000 when you become a California resident.

You are receiving a full tuition scholarship from Berkeley Law and you change your residency status in your 2L year. Let’s say the total amount of nonresident tuition and fees is $75,000 and for California residents, it is $60,000. Your full tuition award will adjust from $75,000 to $60,000 when you obtain California resident status for tuition purposes.

Please feel free to reach out to our office for further clarification or assistance.

										Student Health Insurance (SHIP)
										
All registered students* at the University of California are required to meet the university’s 
health insurance mandate
 (opens in a new tab)
. Students are automatically enrolled in the Berkeley 
Student Health Insurance Plan
 (opens in a new tab)
 (SHIP) as a way to meet this mandate.

If students have 
comparable insurance

										Withdrawals
										
If you decide to withdraw, it’s important to note that the percentage of tuition refunds depends on the effective date of your withdrawal. In addition, if you are a financial aid recipient and withdraw, you may have to pay back all or part of your financial aid as you may no longer be eligible for the full amount of aid. The Office of the Registrar has detailed information about this on their 
website
 (opens in a new tab)
, so please review the information there and reach out to us if you have any questions! 

If you are a financial aid recipient and withdraw, you may have to pay back all or part of your financial aid as you may no longer be eligible for the full amount of aid. To learn more about the impact of withdrawals on financial aid awards, please visit the

Please note:
 UC Berkeley reserves the right to adjust financial aid offers to correct any awarding errors. Changes to qualifying information or revisions of federal, state, or institutional policy may result in updates to aid eligibility and adjustments of financial aid offers.
