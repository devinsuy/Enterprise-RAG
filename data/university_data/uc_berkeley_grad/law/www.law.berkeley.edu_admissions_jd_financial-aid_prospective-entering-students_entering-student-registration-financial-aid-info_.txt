Entering Student Registration & Financial Aid Information
 
				Entering Student Registration & Financial Aid Information				

The information on this page applies to the 
2024-25 academic year
 and is intended for entering 1st year and transfer J.D. students. It is important that you read and understand at least the starred (*) items in order for your registration to proceed smoothly.
 
										CalCentral*

										Obtaining Financial Aid*
										
Visit the “
How to Apply
” section of the Berkeley Law Financial Aid Website for information about applying for university gift aid (grants, scholarships, fellowships), outside (private) scholarships, and student loans.

										Becoming a Registered Student*
										
See the 
Berkeley Registrar’s page
 (opens in a new tab)
 for information on becoming a registered student. Make sure you have completed the Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) through 
CalCentral
 (opens in a new tab)
 by the deadline so that you are assessed the correct fees. If you are using financial aid to cover all or a portion of your fees, make sure you’ve completed the financial aid 
requirements for entering students.

										Using Financial Aid to Pay Fees*
										
If you have completed all of the financial aid
 
requirements for entering students
 on time, your financial aid for that semester should be applied directly to your fees bill by the fees deadline. Any remaining financial aid will be directed to you in the form of a refund (see below).

Note to Visiting Students: If you intend to use financial aid, it must be administered by your home law school. Please request that your home law school financial aid office contact the Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office to make arrangements.

										Fee & Tuition Information*
										
Students are billed and expected to cover tuition and fees on a semester basis. Berkeley Law’s estimated Fees and Cost of Attendance can be found on the 
Tuition and Fees page
. Actual tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year will be published when available, typically in early July. U.C. Berkeley campus fee information can be found on the 
Registration Fees page
 (opens in a new tab)
, and registration and billing due dates can be found on the 
Berkeley Registrar’s page
 (opens in a new tab)
.

All eligible registered students are automatically enrolled in the Berkeley 
Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP)
 (opens in a new tab)
 and charged a health insurance fee. Please see below for more information on the SHIP, including options for waiving this fee.

Until the Residency Office determines that you are a California resident for tuition purposes, the University will charge and expect you to pay non-resident tuition.  You should submit your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) online based on the instructions given to you by the Admissions Office. (See “Residency Status” for more information)

										Receiving a Financial Aid Refund*
										
If you have met all of the financial aid requirements, the fall portion of your financial aid awards will be applied directly to your fees bill. Once your fees and other outstanding charges are paid, the balance of any remaining fall semester funds will be disbursed directly to you. 
The earliest that refunds 
will be available is the 
first day of instruction; please plan accordingly.

The campus requires students to 
set up Direct Deposit
 (opens in a new tab)
  for refunds to be deposited directly into a personal checking or savings bank account. If you have not already done so, you should sign up for Direct Deposit immediately. If you do not authorize Direct Deposit, your refund check will be mailed to you at the address on file. 
We strongly encourage students to set up Direct Deposit 
to avoid possible United States Postal Service (USPS ) delivery delays.

										Residency Status*
										
Until the 
Office of the Registrar
 (opens in a new tab)
 determines that you are a California resident for tuition purposes, the University will charge and expect you to pay non-resident tuition.  You should submit your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) online through CalCentral. Questions about eligibility for California residency should be directed to the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the 
Registrar can be contacted
 (opens in a new tab)
 by phone, or by submitting an inquiry through 
Cal Student Central
 (opens in a new tab)
.

										Private Educational Loans
										
If you are a private educational loan borrower, your loan funds will be applied to your fees bills once funds are received from the lender.  Typically, the lender will send two electronic payments during the academic year — one for the fall and one for the spring semester.  As with other educational loans, once your fees bill is paid in full, the remaining funds will be released to you as a refund.  We estimate that you will need to complete the private educational loan process by July 15 to receive these funds as part of your financial aid refund in late August.

Please notify Berkeley Law’s financial aid office if you intend to borrow a private educational loan for the upcoming academic year to ensure that the loan is certified in a timely manner.

										Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) Waivers
										
You may request a 
SHIP waiver
 (opens in a new tab)
 if you have other comparable coverage. The deadline to submit the waiver is usually in July preceding each academic year.  Actual deadlines can be found here: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance/waiving-ship. SHIP waivers must be requested each year. Visit the SHIP website and review the 
SHIP Waiver FAQs
 (opens in a new tab)
 for more information.

										Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request
										
The total amount of financial aid you are offered cannot exceed your 
Cost of Attendance
, also known as a student budget. As an entering student, you may want to have your student budget increased to account for items that are not automatically included in your Cost of Attendance, such as relocation or computer purchase expenses. In turn, this could increase your student loan eligibility. Please visit the 
Cost of Attendance Adjustments webpage 
for more information.

										Students Chosen For FAFSA Verification
										
After completing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid for federal student loans, you may be asked to submit verification documents to confirm your eligibility for federal student aid. It is in your best interest to submit requested information as soon as possible. View any requested information through 
CalCentral
 (opens in a new tab)
 and contact us if you have any questions.

										Student Loan Deferments
										
Typically, your federal loan service should receive your fall semester enrollment information in a timely manner through Berkeley’s use of the 
National Student Loan Clearinghouse
 (opens in a new tab)
.  This is done automatically for entering students. Download and complete an 
in-school deferment request form
 (opens in a new tab)
 and contact the Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office if you are in repayment and need to send a deferment form to your lender.

										Financial Literacy Education
										
In order to help you learn how to manage your finances while attending Berkeley Law and afterward, we suggest you consult the 
financial-literacy page
.

										Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP)
										
Berkeley Law maintains a strong commitment to public service-oriented graduates, and it is our goal to preserve career choice by removing the student debt barrier. Visit Berkeley Law’s 
LRAP page
 for information about eligibility and procedures. If you intend to pursue a career in public interest after graduation, we strongly encourage you to meet with an LRAP advisor prior to or during your first year at Berkeley Law. Meeting with an LRAP advisor is a requirement for participation in the LRAP program after graduation. 
Schedule an appointment here

										Staying Informed
										
Be sure to check CalCentral for deadlines, tasks, and holds. The Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office will occasionally e-mail you important announcements and events, so it’s also important to check your e-mail.

										Office Hours and Contact Information
										
If you have financial aid questions or need assistance, please contact us at
