Prospective and Entering Students
 
Financial Aid for Undocumented J.D. Students
 
				Financial Aid for Undocumented J.D. Students				

At Berkeley Law, we are proud to welcome and support undocumented students. Although undocumented students are not eligible for federal student aid, they may be eligible for other forms of aid under certain criteria. Financial aid for the J.D. program at Berkeley Law is mainly comprised of federal loans and institutional aid. Currently the state aid for undocumented students through Berkeley remains restricted to undergraduates only who meet certain criteria.

We are dedicated to providing you the resources and options available to pursue your education in law. Please see more information below:

**New** For a limited period of time, the University of California can extend non-State financial aid to undocumented students who do not qualify for AB540 Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST) exemptions, an opportunity previously that was unavailable before July 1, 2019. 

									Frequently Asked Questions 									
			
										Which sources of financial aid am I eligible for?
										
A good starting point is to review the 
eligibility chart
 which shows funding eligibility for graduate students who may meet AB540¹ and/or DACA² criteria, as well as eligibility for undocumented students who meet neither AB540 nor DACA criteria.

California Dream Loan
 (opens in a new tab)
 
– The California Dream Loan is a low-interest subsidized loan for AB540¹ students with financial needs who meet all other financial aid eligibility requirements.

¹Students who, for various reasons, are classified as nonresidents of California, as well as undocumented students, may be eligible for AB540 status. Please learn more details 
here
 (opens in a new tab)
. 

²Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (
DACA
 (opens in a new tab)
) provides certain undocumented young people with work authorization for a period of two years, subject to renewal. 

										Can I apply for gift aid through Berkeley Law?
										
Prior to July 1, 2019, to apply for gift aid (merit and need-based), documentation of lawful presence or 
AB540 eligibility
 (opens in a new tab)
 was required. However, undocumented students without AB540 may qualify for certain forms of institutional gift aid. All students pursuing the J.D. degree at Berkeley Law should review the information on the 
Entering Student Gift Aid
 page to apply. Please note that the selection criteria used to extend this eligibility will not be based solely on the lack of legal presence documentation. Rather, consideration for gift aid will be determined using the same criteria applied to all other applicants. Additionally, aid awarded under these circumstances 
cannot
 be guaranteed for enrollment periods beyond 
June 30, 2027
 due to the sunset provision included in the California State Budget.

										Can I apply for federal student loans?
										
Students who are not U.S. Citizens or eligible non-citizens are 
not eligible for any federal aid
 
such as federal educational loans.

California Dream Act Application (CDAA) information
 (opens in a new tab)
 
–  The California Dream Act Application allows students interested in attending eligible California Colleges, Universities and Career Education Programs to apply for state financial aid. This application is unrelated to the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Please note, Berkeley Law financial aid is not determined by the CDAA. UC Berkeley campus 
may 
use this application to determine eligibility for institutional loans or aid, depending on academic year. Eligible students are encouraged to apply.

										Can I apply for private student loans?
										
Private student loans may be the next best option if you are not eligible for federal student loans. Most private lenders will require the applicant to be a u.s. citizen/eligible non-citizen to be considered, however, some lenders now offer loans to students with DACA so long as they have an eligible U.S. based cosigner. Inquire with lenders directly. Students are encouraged to carefully explore all private loan options available to them by searching online. Private lenders will have varying qualifications, loan terms and loan maximums.

The Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office does not receive, and will not accept, inducements from lenders in exchange for inclusion on the International Loans information page, nor does the Berkeley School of Law share in the profits from student loans.

										Can I apply for Federal Work Study?
										
To apply for federal work-study, you must be an 
eligible non-citizen
 (opens in a new tab)
 (ex. permanent resident, etc.)

										Where can I find private scholarships?
										
UC Berkeley maintains a 
scholarships database
 (opens in a new tab)
. You may be able to find scholarships for which you qualify using the provided filtering options.

Not all organizations have particular citizenship requirements. Please see the Berkeley Law 
outside agency scholarships
 resource, where you can find scholarships for undocumented and/or DACA eligible students, such as the 
Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship.

Immigrants Rising Pre-Law Fund

graduate student scholarships

.

										Can I qualify for in-state tuition?
										
Yes under certain conditions. Please see eligibility chart above and visit the Office of Registrar’s 
tuition exemptions webpage
 (opens in a new tab)
.

										Can I make installment payments on my tuition?
										
Yes. Please see more information on the 
Fee Payment Plan
