Financial Aid
 
Types of Aid
 
Loans
 
				Loans				

Loans are the principal source of aid available to law students to fund their legal education. Loans with the most favorable terms are always made available first to offset student financial need. The vast majority of educational loans are provided by the federal government, but students have the option of determining whether a private loan may make more sense to them financially.
 
Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide. 
 
Please note that only students eligible for federal student aid (typically U.S. citizens and permanent residents) are eligible to receive federal student loans. If you are not eligible for federal or private educational loans, typically Berkeley Law nor the University of California, Berkeley will be able to provide you with an institutional loan. Students eligible for the California DREAM Act, see below for loan options. 
 
										Applying for Loans
										
To submit a general application for federal loans, the following are required:

Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
 (opens in a new tab)
 – every year

Master Promissory Note for the Unsubsidized Loan
 (opens in a new tab)
 – first year at Berkeley Law only (with a few exceptions)

Master Promissory Note for the Graduate PLUS Loan
 (opens in a new tab)
 – first year at Berkeley Law only (with a few exceptions)

Combined Entrance Counseling
 (opens in a new tab)
 for both the Direct Unsubsidized and Graduate PLUS loans – first year at Berkeley Law only

To determine whether a private loan makes more sense for you financially and given your long term goals, visit our webpage on 
Private Educational loans.

For more information on the timeline for applying for financial aid, including loans, see our 
entering student checklist
 or 
continuing student checklist
.

Please keep in mind:

Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Graduate PLUS Loans take roughly two to three weeks to process after we receive your FAFSA.

Graduate PLUS Loans require a credit check.

Additional time may be required if your MPN or Entrance Counseling is delayed or incomplete.

The campus stops processing loan applications about a couple of weeks before the end of the spring semester for that academic year.

Students applying for loans during the academic year must therefore plan to submit their applications one month before they need the disbursement and 
at least one month before the end of the spring semester for that academic year
. 
It is your responsibility to abide by each loan’s individual timeline and to stay informed of any changes.

										Accepting and Modifying Your Loans
										
In order to receive your loans, you must apply for loans each year and accept the amount you wish to borrow in the Award Details page of your CalCentral account. Each year your accepted loans will be disbursed in two equal payments minus the loan origination fee; typically half for fall semester and half for spring semester. However if you require an alternative disbursement, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

You have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without being charged interest or other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of your loan’s original disbursement date. Please note that if you cancel or reduce a loan that has already disbursed, a charge will be applied to your account within approximately 2 to 3 business days and will create a balance due. You are responsible for paying this balance so that Berkeley can return the funds to the lender. 

To request a reduction (i.e. return) loan funds, please submit your request to the Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office via the 
Loan Modification Request Form
 (opens in a new tab)
 and contact us if you have any questions.

If it has been more than 120 days since your loan disbursement date, you cannot cancel your loan. However, you can make a payment to your servicer. Locate the servicer’s contact information by logging into your federal student loan account at 
studentaid.gov
 (opens in a new tab)
. 

As always, 
visit our FAQ
 for more information on accepting and modifying loans. 

										Loan Options

										Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans
										
A maximum of $20,500 per year is available. Interest accrues on the Direct Loans during periods of enrollment and continues through repayment, which begins six months following graduation or after a student’s enrollment status drops to less than half-time. Repayment can be made over a 10-25 year term, however, there is no early repayment penalty.

For more information about accepting loans, please visit our 
FAQ
 page.

										Grad PLUS Loans
										
Sample Grad PLUS Loan Offer 

$85,000 Academic Year Cost of Attendance

-$10,000 Gift Aid

-$20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan

=$54,500 Grad PLUS Loan

Students who need to borrow funds beyond the Direct Unsubsidized loan limits will be able to choose between the federal Graduate PLUS Loan (“Grad PLUS”) and a private educational loan.

The Direct Grad PLUS being offered at UC Berkeley has a fixed interest rate and no annual or aggregate borrowing limits (other than cost of attendance less other financial aid received). While credit checks are required to be eligible for the Grad PLUS, the credit criteria are less strict than those associated with private student loans. Furthermore, if you do not meet the credit requirements for a Grad PLUS, you may still obtain the loan with an endorser who does meet the credit requirements.

Q: What is considered to be an adverse credit history?

A: For purposes of qualifying for a Direct PLUS Loan, you’re considered to have an adverse credit history if:

you have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that are 90 or more days delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or that have been placed in collection or charged off (written off) during the two years preceding the date of the credit report; or

during the five years preceding the date of the credit report, you have been subject to a:

default determination,

discharge of debts in bankruptcy,

foreclosure,

repossession,

tax lien,

wage garnishment, or

write-off of a federal student aid debt.

We encourage you to determine how much money you will need for the academic year and take out as little as possible to reduce your debt burden upon graduating. If you accept less than the maximum amount offered to you, you have until late April of the spring semester to accept additional amounts of the loan. We are available to assist you in determining the appropriate amount of loan to borrow.

For more information about accepting loans, please visit our 
FAQ
 page.

										California DREAM Loan
										
Beginning in 2020-21, students who qualify for filing a 
California Dream Act Application (CDAA)
 (opens in a new tab)
 may be eligible for up to $4,000 per academic year through the
 DREAM Loan Program. 
 (opens in a new tab)

										Private Educational Loans
										
Although we encourage students to carefully weigh the benefits of federal education loans compared to private educational loans, we make both types of loans available to our students. To apply for a private educational loan, submit an application with the lender of your choice and 
notify our office
 of your pending application. You may use any lender, but we suggest that you compare their loan terms with those on the University of California’s 
Preferred Lender List
 (opens in a new tab)
. Maximum eligibility is based on the cost of attendance less gift-aid received. If you have questions about your eligibility for a private loan, send an email to 
financial-aid@law.berkeley.edu

A list of allowable expenses can be found on the
 forms webpage

Forms
 page after the start of the fall term and should be submitted to the Berkeley Law Financial Aid Office.

										SB 1289 Disclosure
										
The State of California requires that you be told the following:

Students considering student loans need to be aware of the differences between federal student loans and private student loans:

Federal student loans are required by law to provide a range of flexible repayment options including, but not limited to, income-based and income-contingent repayment plans, as well as loan forgiveness benefits that private lenders are not required to provide.

Federal direct loans are available to most students regardless of income. Other qualification criteria do apply. For more information, please visit 
https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility
 (opens in a new tab)
.

Private student loan lenders can offer variable interest rates that can increase or decrease over time, depending on market conditions.

The interest rate on a private loan may depend on the borrower’s and/or co-signer’s credit rating.

Some UC campuses offer students their own private (institutional) student loans. Students offered a UC institutional private student loan should know that: Private student loans have a range of interest rates and fees and students should determine the interest rate of, and any fees associated with, the private student loan included in their financial aid award package before accepting the loan.  Students should contact the lender of the private student loan or their UC campus’ financial aid office if they have any questions about a private student loan.

Interest rates on UC loans will be fixed, not variable

UC loans can have a range of interest rates

UC loans are not awarded based on the credit history of the borrower

UC loans do not require a co-signer.
