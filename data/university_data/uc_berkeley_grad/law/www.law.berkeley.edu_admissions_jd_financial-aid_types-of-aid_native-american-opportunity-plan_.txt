Native American Opportunity Plan
 
				Native American Opportunity Plan				

Beginning in Fall 2022, the 
University of California’s Native American Opportunity Plan 
 (opens in a new tab)
ensures that in-state systemwide Tuition (formerly known as the Educational Fee) and Student Services Fees are fully covered for California students who are also enrolled in 
federally recognized
 (opens in a new tab)
 Native American, American Indian, and Alaska Native tribes. This plan applies to eligible undergraduate and graduate students. 
At Berkeley Law, we will provide additional funding for eligible Native American Opportunity Plan students by covering the Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition.
  
Students are not required to file a financial aid application to qualify for the Native American Opportunity Plan. 

Note:
 
If you are a member of a tribe that is not federally recognized, additional support may be available through external organizations, including the 
Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria
 (opens in a new tab)
. We encourage you to work with the 
Native American Student Development Office
 (opens in a new tab)
 or the 
American Indian Graduate Program
 (opens in a new tab)
 to identify these opportunities.

Eligibility requirements

To be eligible for the Native American Opportunity Plan, UC Berkeley students must meet all of the following criteria:

A current or newly admitted law school student*; 

a California resident for tuition purposes;

an enrolled member in a federally recognized Native American, American Indian, and/or Alaska Native tribe; 
and

enrolled in a state-supported degree program (i.e., self-supporting and certificate programs do not qualify)

*UC Berkeley undergraduate students as well as graduate or professional students other than law school students should visit the 
main campus Financial Aid and Scholarships Office page.
 (opens in a new tab)

Award Amounts

The Native American Opportunity plan combines all sources of grants, scholarships, tuition- and fee-specific awards you receive from federal, state, UC, and private sources (e.g. Dean’s Fellowship; Berkeley Law Grant; Continuing Student Scholarships; veteran’s tuition benefits; tribal benefits; University, Departmental, or external fellowships that are specific for tuition and fees; tuition and fee remissions; etc.) to count toward covering your fees. If the total of your aid from these sources is more than your UC systemwide tuition, student service fees, and Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition, then the Native American Opportunity Plan promise has been satisfied. However, if the total of your aid from these sources does not fully cover your UC systemwide tuition, student service fees, and Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition, your Native American Opportunity Plan award will make up the difference with UC grant funding.

* BL Opportunity Scholars and Public Interest Scholars cover the full tuition and fees, so there will be no additional Native American Opportunity Plan funding available. 

Next Steps

The main campus Financial Aid and Scholarships Office will coordinate with the Native American Student Development Office, the American Indian Graduate Program, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Residency Office to identify eligible students. They will notify new and continuing students who might be eligible for funding under the Native American Opportunity Plan with guidance on next steps. 

Documentation of tribal enrollment will be collected and reviewed prior to awarding. Eligible students may submit any of the following forms of documentation:

Certification of tribal enrollment on tribal letterhead.

Enrollment/membership card that contains the tribal seal and/or official signature of a tribal leader.

Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) if the CDIB includes tribal enrollment information.

Tribal identification card with an enrollment number.

Eligible students also need to submit tribal contact information (address, phone, and email) with the submitted documentation.

Note:
 
Students who meet the eligibility requirements and have gift aid equal to, or in excess of, systemwide graduate tuition, student services fees, and professional degree supplemental tuition, will not be asked to submit documentation.

									Frequently Asked Questions and Answers									
			
										My residency status is pending or I’m in the process of changing my residency status from a non-resident to a CA resident. Do I qualify for the Native American Opportunity Plan?
										
You may be eligible for the Native American Opportunity Plan if you meet all eligibility criteria listed above. Once the Registrar’s Office confirms that you are a California resident, we will automatically review your eligibility and award the NAOP if you are eligible. Please reach out to our Financial Aid Office if your NAOP award is not on your account within 2 weeks after your residency is confirmed.  

										Are the funds provided to students through the UC Native American Opportunity Plan considered loans? Will students have to pay them back?
										
No, these funds are not loans and students do not need to pay them back. They fall under the category of tuition remission, grants, and scholarships from federal, state, university or private sources.

										Which fees are covered?
										
The program promises that systemwide Tuition and Student Services Fees, which are assessed to all California residents, will be covered by grants or scholarships. Campus fees and Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition are not part of the Native American Opportunity Plan. However, Berkeley Law will provide funding to cover the Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition in addition to the systemwide Tuition and Student Services Fees. 

										Why is this aid limited to Native American students from federally recognized tribes?
										
UC is bound by state law, specifically Proposition 209, which prohibits the University of California from providing financial aid to students based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin. UC can provide financial aid to students based on their membership in federally recognized tribes because such membership is legally deemed a political classification, rather than a racial classification, due to the sovereign-to-sovereign relationship that the law recognizes between the federal government and federally recognized tribes.

										What kinds of support will be available to Native American students from non-federally recognized tribes?
										
UC consulted with tribal leaders to develop the UC Native American Opportunity Plan. This consultation included discussions on how to benefit all Native American students, including those from non-federally recognized tribes. California’s Native American tribes and other external organizations may provide scholarships to Native American students who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. The 
Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria

 announced a scholarship fund which will cover UC tuition and mandatory fees for all eligible California Native American students, and the scholarship deadline is July 15.

										Is the plan only available to members of federally recognized tribes that are located within California?
										
No. The UC Native American Opportunity Plan is available to California residents who are enrolled members of any federally recognized Native American, American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.

										Will my Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition (PDST) be covered if I’m in a concurrent or combined degree program?
										
It depends. Some concurrent or combined degree programs require students to be enrolled in one program at a time. If you are completing a J.D. program this year and the other degree program next year, your PDST will only be covered while you are completing the J.D. program. The same rule applies to students who are taking J.D. courses in Fall 2022 and the other degree program’s courses in spring 2023. Their Fall 2022 PDST will be covered but not for spring 2023.
