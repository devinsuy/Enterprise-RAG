How to Sign In as a SPA

        To sign in to a Special Purpose Account (SPA) via a list, add a "
+
" to your CalNet ID 
        (e.g., "
+mycalnetid
"), then enter your passphrase. The next screen will show a drop-down 
        list of all the SPAs you have permission to access. Select the SPA you wish to sign in as.
    
        To sign in directly as a SPA, enter the SPA name, "
+
", and your CalNet ID into 
        the CalNet ID field (e.g., “
spa-mydept+mycalnetid
”), 
        then enter your passphrase.
    
        To view and manage your SPAs, log into the 
Special Purpose Accounts
 application with your personal credentials.
