J.D. Admissions
 
Outreach Partnerships
 
				Outreach Partnerships				

The J.D. Admissions Office actively seeks to connect and partner with other organizations and programs to strengthen, support, and diversify the pipeline to law school. We have several longstanding partnerships and are always willing to explore other possibilities. Often, these partnerships include group visits at Berkeley Law and information sessions about the law school admissions process. You may also be eligible for an application 
fee waiver
 if you participated in a qualifying partnership program (please see the full list on the fee waiver application). If your organization is interested in partnering with our office, please contact 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu
.

High School Outreach

Often classes, programs, or law academies at local high schools are interested in their students visiting the campus and learning about the law school experience. The Admissions Office supports these efforts by working with the teacher or school to tailor a visit that will be meaningful for the students. Due to the high degree of customization, we can only accommodate one visit per semester. Requests can be made by emailing 
admissions@law.berkeley.edu
.

									UC Berkeley Partners									
			
										PPIA (Public Policy and International Affairs) Junior Summer Institute, with the Goldman School of Public Policy
										
Program Information

 (opens in a new tab)

Online Application
 (opens in a new tab)

Overview

Berkeley Law has joined forces with the Goldman School of Public Policy to empower and prepare the next generation of leaders and change makers, and to better address the needs of historically under-served communities. The UCPPIA Law Fellows program is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to complete challenging academic work, learn what it takes to gain admission to elite J.D./M.P.P. programs, collaborate to study and attack some of the most pressing global challenges, and experience life at Berkeley.

Goldman’s PPIA Junior Summer Institute (JSI) has existed for thirty-five years. For the last nine years, Berkeley Law has supported and invested in select students within the JSI who are focused on pursuing law and public policy degrees, and on meeting the needs of under-represented communities. These students are selected by a committee that includes a Berkeley Law Admissions officer. 

The JSI offers student participants a rigorous 7-week program of coursework designed to improve the analytical and quantitative skills vital to success at top-level graduate programs in public policy, and law school. A cohort of thirty students spend their summer on Berkeley’s campus, learning from faculty, staff, community leaders, and each other. Ten of those students are selected as “Law Fellows.” In addition to learning the fundamentals of policy analysis, Law Fellows are exposed to the topics and skills necessary to gain admission to and succeed at a top law school.  

Specifically, Law Fellows: 

Take a Public Policy and Law course, in addition to the required Policy Analysis, Economics and Quantitative Methods courses. This course is designed to provide students with the fundamental skills of reading case law, analyzing judicial decisions, and discussing relevant policy topics within a legal framework. The course begins with an introductory framework for policy and legal analysis followed by week-long modules that focus on important policy and legal topics taught by faculty members from Berkeley Law.

Receive GRE and LSAT preparation materials.

Are guaranteed an application fee waiver for the J.D. program at Berkeley Law.

Attend career development workshops (including resume workshops) fellowship opportunities and a networking events.

Hear from advocates working in law/public policy areas such as immigration and human rights, education, health, environmental regulation, policing, and housing.

Participate in field trips geared toward introducing participants to the different aspects of policy-making and legal advocacy, and the various careers associated with these fields.

Partake in extracurricular activities intended to create a foundation for successful group dynamics among PPIA faculty, staff and fellow participants.

Participate in a series of sessions focused on navigating the J.D. application process, with special emphasis on writing the personal statement and financial aid.

Tour Berkeley Law School and attend an information session with the Dean of Admissions.

Other Benefits:

Full tuition to attend the U.C. Berkeley PPIA Junior Summer Institute, plus a stipend and room & board in one of the U.C. Berkeley dormitories.

Minimum of $5,000 in gift aid (scholarship or grant) guaranteed toward graduate or law school tuition. UCPPIA Fellows often receive financial offers above and beyond this minimum.

Eligibility for paid internships and other professional development opportunities through PPIA.

										G.I.G.S. (Getting into Graduate School)
										
Getting into Grad School (GiGS)
 (opens in a new tab)
 is a collaborative partnership between the Office for Graduate Diversity (OGD), and the Graduate Assembly (GA), whose ultimate goal is to encourage and prepare undergraduate UC Berkeley students to select, apply, and enroll in graduate school.

By engaging key staff and graduate student mentors with motivated undergraduates, we hope undergraduates leave the mentoring program with a better understanding of what the process entails and are inspired to pursue academic careers and create change in the future.

										Underground Scholars
										
Berkeley Underground Scholars
 (BUS)
 (opens in a new tab)
 creates a pathway for incarcerated, formerly incarcerated and system impacted individuals into higher education. We are building a prison-to-school pipeline through recruitment, retention, and advocacy. BUS is an academic support program housed within the Division of Equity and Inclusion at UC Berkeley.

										Golden Bear Orientation and Getting Your Bearings (for new students)
										
Golden Bear Orientation
 (opens in a new tab)
 is the third phase of the Golden Bear Experience which begins August 17 and ends August 22, 2022.  During Golden Bear Orientation (GBO), new students are placed in groups with two Orientation Leaders, continuing UC Berkeley students, who guide their group through all kinds of programming throughout the week. Some example events include community bonding, learning about affinity spaces, becoming familiar with resources on campus, and exploring the Bay Area. In these groups, new students are placed with other students who have a similar housing experience (i.e., being placed in the same group as those dorming in the same building, those who commute to campus, those living off-campus, etc.). This gives students the chance to meet other new incoming students, build connections, and find community. 

After Golden Bear Orientation, you may participate in 
Getting Your Bearings
 (opens in a new tab)
, a collection of events sponsored by campus departments and student organizations, for newly admitted undergraduates. It starts the day after Golden Bear Orientation and lasts through the first three weeks of the semester. You may choose from hundreds of events, participating in the ones that mean the most to you.

Fall 2022 dates: August 23 – September 9 

Spring 2023 dates: January 17 – February 10

Check out the 
Cal Events app
 (opens in a new tab)
 for events and links in the fall. Although it is not mandatory, Getting Your Bearings offers ways you can shape your experience at Cal, dig deeper into community, and just have fun!

										ASUC Pre-Law Committee
										
The ASUC Pre-Law Committee is a formal body of undergraduate Berkeley ASUC executives and various Pre-Law organizations aiming to increase the sustainability and accessibility of Pre-Law initiatives. The committee’s strategic goals act to ensure all communities are accurately represented in discussions on increasing equity of opportunity for UC Berkeley undergraduates. Sponsored by UC Berkeley’s student government, the committee’s programs include the Pre-Law Decal, Mentorship Program, and more.

									California Partners

’s programs immerse East Bay youth who are first-generation and/or from marginalized communities in environments that might otherwise seem inaccessible: classes and activities on the U.C. Berkeley campus and internships in law, government and social justice offices. 

Our individualized support, social/emotional learning curriculum, stipends and ongoing mentoring enable the youth to flourish in these environments, and beyond.  Our participants also engage deeply with community issues that are relevant to their lives.       

More than 92% of our program participants go on to attend higher education!  Many also use our program as a springboard to civic engagement and careers in community service and social justice. 

										Fresh Lifelines for Youth (FLY)
										
Fresh Lifelines for Youth (FLY)
 (opens in a new tab)
 is an award-winning nonprofit serving Bay Area youth impacted by the justice system. Our programs connect young people with positive mentors and role models, promote their understanding of the law and their rights, and support them to become leaders among their peers and in their communities. Together with our young people, we also help our justice systems become more just, humane, and equitable.

Diversity in the legal profession is an ongoing issue. Together, Black people and Latinos make up nearly 45% of California population, yet only comprise about 7% of the state bar. The 
Diversity Legal Pipeline (DLP)
 (opens in a new tab)
 seeks to increase diversity in the law by providing law-school bound undergraduates of color with the information, experience and advising necessary to be successful in the law school application process.

The DLP is an intensive, 
week long pre-law bootcamp 
that introduces students to the law school application process and puts them face to face with law students, lawyers, and judges who affirm that a legal education is within their reach. During one week from June 10-14, students will participate in a mock constitutional law class, take an actual LSAT, read real court cases, and have plenty of time to meet and network with other students and legal professionals over zoom. After the bootcamp, students are offered supplemental support to assist them on their path to law school. 
Application Deadline: Wednesday, May 24, 2024.

										Legal Education Access Pipeline, Inc. (LEAP)
										
The mission of

 is to diversify the legal profession by preparing underrepresented students to become successful law school applicants, lawyers, and agents of social change.

We support students who are historically underrepresented in the field: people of color, people who identify as LGBTQ+, first-generation college students, and people who are socioeconomically-disadvantaged.

LEAP provides comprehensive programming through focused workshops, LSAT prep courses, mentoring, and a moot court competition. 
Programming is designed to prepare participants for a successful career in law by helping them successfully apply to law school, excel as law students, and flourish in their legal communities afterward.

										Pathway to Law Initiative: Native American Law School Admissions Workshop
										
The 
Pathway to Law Initiative
 (opens in a new tab)
 is sponsored by the Indian Legal Program at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, the Indigenous Law Program at Michigan State University College of Law, Office of Admissions at University of California, Berkeley School of Law, and the American Indian Law Center, Inc. This program also receives support from the National Native American Bar Association, Native American Bar Association of Arizona, TestMasters, and the National Native American Law Students Association.

The 2015 National Native American Bar Association study of Native Americans in the legal field (
The Pursuit of Inclusion: An In-Depth Exploration of the Experiences and Perspective of Native American Attorneys in the Legal Profession
), concluded that the Native American law student population is lower than the rate of Native Americans in the overall U.S. population. The study found that pathway projects reaching students in earlier stages of education are essential to continuing the gains in Native American law student numbers and success. In response to the issues identified in the 2015 National Native American Bar Association survey, the Indian Legal Program and the Indigenous Law Program are joining together to strengthen the Native American pathway to law.

This important initiative has been funded by grants from Access Group, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.

Register now for the for 8th Annual Native American Pathway to Law workshop.

This workshop will be held June 8 – June 12, 2022. Application is due April 15. Space is limited so submit your registration today.
