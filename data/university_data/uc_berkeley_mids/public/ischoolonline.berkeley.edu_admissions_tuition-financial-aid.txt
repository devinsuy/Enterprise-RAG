Tuition and Fees

The I School’s online students are assessed program tuition fees, which are charged per enrolled unit of coursework, and the Berkeley campus fee, which is charged per enrolled semester. The online master’s programs are 27 units each.* Students are also assessed the Document Management Fee, which is a one-time fee charged in the first term of enrollment.

Starting in the Fall 2024 semester, all MIDS/MICS students must have health insurance that meets the University’s criteria. Students will be automatically enrolled in and charged for the UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) to meet this requirement. In order to opt out of UC SHIP, students must have other medical health insurance that meets all of the 
waiver criteria

open_in_new
 and must complete an 
online waiver application
External link:
open_in_new
 by the specified deadline. The cost of SHIP in the 2023-24 Academic Year (Fall 2023, Spring/Summer 2024) is $3,078 per semester (Fall and Spring/Summer) or $6,155 per year. The 2024-25 AY SHIP fee will be announced in July 2024.

Additionally, for each program there will be a $500 immersion fee. Students will also be responsible for the cost of their hotel stay during the immersion and travel to and from the immersion. Fees are subject to change each academic year; new fees typically take effect in the fall term.

*The online master’s programs are 30 units for Minnesota and Arkansas residents.

MIDS

Estimated total tuition and fees for the degree for a new student starting Fall 2023 are currently $81,633, not including health insurance; most students complete the degree in approximately two years. The exact amount of tuition and fees may depend on a variety of factors including number of semesters enrolled, whether students are enrolled in summer terms, and future fees or increases determined by the UC Regents. Refund schedules are determined by the Office of the Registrar.

¹The tuition, fees, and charges displayed here are estimates based on currently approved amounts. These figures may not be final. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by State funding reductions. Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown. Students should expect fees to moderately increase each fall term.

During the summer term, IREF (the Instructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee) is charged only to first-term students or students who were on a leave of absence during the preceding spring.

** Students have the option to waive the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) if they have other major medical health insurance that meet the 
SHIP waiver criteria

 and don’t wish to have dual coverage. For waiver qualifications, instructions, forms, and FAQs, please see

Financial Aid

U.S. citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply for federal financial aid programs, which include student loans. We encourage you to apply for financial aid as early as possible. To be eligible for federal financial aid, students must be registered in a minimum of 6 units per semester. Students who choose to take a less accelerated path toward completion of the degree should be aware that this will impact federal financial aid eligibility.

To apply for federal aid, complete the 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

. The Federal School Code for UC Berkeley is 001312.

A small number of immersion fellowships will be offered each immersion. The fellowships will cover the $500 fee; recipients will still be responsible for travel and the cost of their stay.
Student loans: U.S. citizens and permanent residents can apply for Federal Direct Loans or Federal Direct Graduate PLUS loans by completing the FAFSA. Please reference the chart below to determine which FAFSA to complete based on your desired start date. Any student can apply for a private student loan.

Sponsorship Tips

One of the ways that students fund their master’s degree program is through employer sponsorship. While your company may not advertise that this funding is available, they may have funds available to you if you put in a request.

Beyond funding, employers can also support your degree progress through adding flexibility to your schedule and providing new challenges and opportunities to take advantage of your growing skill set. Having a scheduled conversation to discuss your professional development goals is a great idea to help foster support, in whatever form it may take.

For information to help you request employer support or sponsorship, download our sponsorship tips sheet:

Private Loan Option for International Students

Private loans (also known as alternative loans) can help fill the gap between the cost of education and the amount of other financial aid offered. Private lenders vary in interest rates, terms, and eligibility requirements.
