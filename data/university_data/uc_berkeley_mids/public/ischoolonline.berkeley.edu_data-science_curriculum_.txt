MIDS Class Profile

Curriculum

The online Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) is designed to educate data science leaders. The professional degree program prepares students to derive insights from real-world data sets, use the latest tools and analytical methods, and interpret and communicate their findings in ways that change minds and behaviors. The program features a multidisciplinary curriculum that draws on insights from the social sciences, computer science, statistics, management, and law.

Acquired Skills

The MIDS core curriculum focuses on the following key skills:

Research Design
Data Engineering
Machine Learning
Mining and Exploring

Data Visualization
Ethics and Privacy
Statistical Analysis
Communicating Results

Like all programs offered by the I School, MIDS features a project-based approach to learning and encourages the pragmatic application of a variety of tools and methods to solve complex problems. MIDS students may receive access to Amazon Web Services and IBM’s big data platform to complete specific coursework.

The program is fully accredited by the 
Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)

Program Requirements

The Master of Information and Data Science is designed to be completed in 20 months, but other options are available to complete the program on an accelerated basis. You will complete 27 units of coursework over three to five terms
1
. Courses are 3 units each, and divided into foundation courses, advanced courses, and a synthetic capstone. You will also complete an immersion at the UC Berkeley campus.

The curriculum prepares students to ask good questions of data by defining (and refining) business or research questions that are relevant and tractable in order to use data to inform decision making. You will learn best practices for data collection and engineering — and how these factors affect timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of large-scale storage models.

Students learn to apply the latest statistical and computational methods for identifying patterns, extracting insights, and making predictions from complex data sets. You will be given the opportunity to hone your skills in effectively communicating findings of data analysis and dealing with the ethical dilemmas and legal requirements associated with working with real-world data at scale.

The program’s courses are divided into foundation courses, advanced courses, and a synthetic capstone.

Program Paths

The MIDS program consists of 27 units and can be completed on one of three paths: accelerated, standard, or decelerated. Students who wish to take the program on an accelerated or decelerated basis must receive approval from UC Berkeley.

The accelerated path
 gives students the opportunity to take three courses per semester to complete the program in as few as 12 months.

The standard path
 is designed for working professionals and can be completed in 20 months, with two courses per semester.

The decelerated path
 allows students to drop down to one course per semester after the first term and complete the program in no more than 32 months.

Foundation Courses

Students who are proficient in object oriented programming and pass the Introduction to Data Science Programming waiver exam will complete 12 units of foundation coursework, 12 units of advanced coursework and the synthetic capstone course.

Students who are not proficient in object oriented programming or do not pass the waiver exam are required to complete the Introduction to Data Science Programming foundation course as part of their 15 units of foundation coursework, 9 units of advanced coursework and the synthetic capstone course.

Capstone Course

MIDS students will complete a capstone by executing a culminating project that integrates the core skills and concepts learned throughout the program. The capstone combines the technical, analytical, interpretive, and social dimensions required to design and execute a full data science project. Students will learn integral skills that prepare them for long-term professional success in the field.

Synthetic Capstone Course

3 UNITS

Immersion

While all courses are delivered online, students are required to attend at least one, 3–4 day 
immersion on the UC Berkeley campus
 or in other locations relevant to data science. During the immersion, Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) students benefit from meeting classmates and professors in person, participating in workshops, and networking with other data science professionals. Immersions are crafted to deliver additional learning, networking, and community-building opportunities to MIDS students.
