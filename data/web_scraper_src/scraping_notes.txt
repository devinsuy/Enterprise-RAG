1. Find the best url to start from to recursively expand out to
	- EX: catalog.csulb.edu

2. It should have info:
	- Programs / degrees available
	- Overview of courses
	- Degree requirements

3. Determine what type of urls to skip:
	- We (probably) shouldnt expand courses

		- Leads to WAY too much data

		- Takes forever

		- Probably wont even fit in out system

	- EX: Specifically had to a look for a span that said [ARCHIVED CATALOG] and skipped these
		- Couldn't tell from the url so still have to expand

	- EX: did not expand urls with /preview_course in

	- EX: Skipped expansion of fragment identifiers, doesn't seem to generate new content, takes forever
		- catalog.csulb.edu/content.php
		- catalog.csulb.edu/content.php#some-resource
		- catalog.csulb.edu/content.php/#another-resource


4. Watch the output in browser to see if there are other things we should skip/avoid scraping

5. Run the script to clean the whitespace up
