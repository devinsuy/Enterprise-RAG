This course covers everything from the basics of the image formation process in digital cameras and biological systems, through a mathematical and practical treatment of basic image processing, space/frequency representations, classical computer vision techniques for making 3-D measurements from images, and modern deep-learning based techniques for image classification and recognition. Student Learning Outcomes Be able to read and understand research papers in the computer-vision literature. Build computer vision systems to solve real-world problems. Properly formulate problems with the appropriate mathematical and computational tools. Understand the building blocks of classical computer vision techniques. Understand the building blocks of modern computer vision techniques (primarily artificial neural networks). Understand the process by which images are formed and represented.

       "\"The main differences between 5th Year MIDS students and regular MIDS students at UC Berkeley are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Streamlined Path for Cal Undergraduates:**\\n   - The 5th Year MIDS program offers a streamlined path to the MIDS degree specifically for UC Berkeley undergraduates, allowing them to transition directly into the master's program.\\n\\n2. **Program Duration and Structure:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS is a lock-step program that requires students to complete the degree over four consecutive semesters (fall, spring, summer, and fall).\\n   - Students in the 5th Year MIDS program are required to enroll in specific DATASCI courses each term in a predefined sequence.\\n\\n3. **Summer Practicum and Internship Encouragement:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students are required to complete a 1-unit summer practicum course (DATASCI 293) and are strongly encouraged to pursue a full-time internship during the summer semester, although it is not mandatory.\\n   - This focus on a summer practicum and internship differentiates it from the regular MIDS program, which may have different requirements and structure for practical experience.\\n\\n4. **Course Waivers:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students with a strong foundation in relevant topics may be eligible to waive certain courses (DATASCI 200, 203, and/or 205) by passing waiver exams.\\n\\n5. **Enrollment and Course Requirements:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students must enroll in the 5th Year MIDS-specific sections of required foundation and capstone courses. They can choose any DATASCI section for advanced courses.\\n\\n6. **Work Limitations:**\\n   - Due to the rigor of the program, 5th Year MIDS students are limited to working 10 hours per week (25% time) during the fall and spring semesters, unless they obtain approval to work more hours from the I Schoolâ€™s senior director of student affairs.\\n\\n7. **Immersion Program Requirement:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students are required to attend at least one in-person immersion program before the end of their final term.\\n\\n8. **Federal Financial Aid Eligibility:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students are not eligible for federal financial aid in the summer semester due to the typical enrollment of only one unit during that term.\\n\\nThese differences highlight that the 5th Year MIDS program is designed to be a continuous, immersive experience tailored for recent UC Berkeley undergraduates, with specific academic and practical components to ensure a smooth transition from undergraduate to graduate studies in data science.\""
