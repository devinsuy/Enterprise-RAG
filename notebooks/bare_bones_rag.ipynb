This course covers everything from the basics of the image formation process in digital cameras and biological systems, through a mathematical and practical treatment of basic image processing, space/frequency representations, classical computer vision techniques for making 3-D measurements from images, and modern deep-learning based techniques for image classification and recognition. Student Learning Outcomes Be able to read and understand research papers in the computer-vision literature. Build computer vision systems to solve real-world problems. Properly formulate problems with the appropriate mathematical and computational tools. Understand the building blocks of classical computer vision techniques. Understand the building blocks of modern computer vision techniques (primarily artificial neural networks). Understand the process by which images are formed and represented.

They can choose any DATASCI section for advanced courses.\\n\\n6. **Work Limitations:**\\n   - Due to the rigor of the program, 5th Year MIDS students are limited to working 10 hours per week (25% time) during the fall and spring semesters, unless they obtain approval to work more hours from the I School’s senior director of student affairs.\\n\\n7. **Immersion Program Requirement:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students are required to attend at least one in-person immersion program before the end of their final term.\\n\\n8. **Federal Financial Aid Eligibility:**\\n   - 5th Year MIDS students are not eligible for federal financial aid in the summer semester due to the typical enrollment of only one unit during that term.\\n\\nThese differences highlight that the 5th Year MIDS program is designed to be a continuous, immersive experience tailored for recent UC Berkeley undergraduates, with specific academic and practical components to ensure a smooth transition from undergraduate to graduate studies in data science.\""
